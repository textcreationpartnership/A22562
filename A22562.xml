            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For he lived before the battell of <hi>Ioaſh</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> about the end of the dayes of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.14. and 14.25.

                  <p>True it is, this prophet hath this end and yſſue of his writing with the reſt, to ſet forth the judgements and mercies of God toward mankind: but this he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar, that he is not here ſent unto the Church and people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but onely unto prophane unbeleevers and uncircumciſed perſons, that we ſhould underſtand thereby, that God hath rule over all nations, and is <hi>the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Iewes;</hi>

And doubtleſſe by his ſending of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to ſtrangers out of the promiſed land, God would reprove and condemne the deſperate ſtubbornneſſe of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who would not be moved and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſo many of his holy Prophets that were ſent and dwelt among them, and by ſo many threatnings as were brought upon them; where as theſe poore infidels and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers did by and by beleeve and obey the voyce of one

                     <note place="margin">Epiphan. of the life of the Prophets.</note> touching this <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</hi> For he telleth us, that <hi>Elias</hi> gat himſalfe into the Wilderneſſe by reaſon of a great famine which hee had called upon the land, where, being nouriſhed by Ravens, he quenched his thirſt with the water of the brooke, and when the brooke was dryed up, hee was an hungred, and removed into <hi>Sarepta</hi> a Citie of <hi>Sidonia,</hi>

And when as <hi>Ionah</hi> the ſonne of the woman was decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, God raiſed him up by <hi>Elias,</hi> and reſtored him alive unto his mother, becauſe of the entertainement which ſhe gave unto him: and that when <hi>Ionah</hi> was come to full age, he was ſent unto <hi>Nineveh</hi> to the Aſſyrians. Where we have ſome truth mingled with much falſehood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſerveth to be credited no farther, then he hath the warrant of Gods word, being deceived with the tales of the Iewes that are maſters of ſuch lyes. I know the common ſort are moſt of all delighted with ſuch new tangled deviſes that have no ſubſtance in them: howbeit we ſhould not pleaſe ſuch itching eares, nor feed them with empty winde in ſtead of wholeſome food: but <hi>avoid prophane bablings, and oppoſitions of ſcience falſly ſo called, which ſome profeſſing, have erred concerning the faith.</hi>

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:21898:9"/>whereby we may ſee his errour and overſight in flying from his function, and ſuppoſing that he was ſent in vaine: when as afterward he beheld with his owne eyes ſo worthy and glorious an effect of his preaching,
<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2.19.20.</note> as might rejoyce his heart, and <hi>be his crowne and glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and in the preſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But yet for all this, it did not ſufficiently content the Prophet through a carnall miſdeeming and miſjudging of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his labours, as if by Gods ſhewing of mercy, his miniſtery were contemned, his credit empaired, and his perſon ſcorned and expoſed to contempt, becauſe the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was ſpared and not deſtroyed, as appeareth in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>In the 4. Verſe and the reſt that follow to the end of the Chapter, we are to conſider two things. Firſt the preaching of <hi>Ionah,</hi> Verſe 4. A Sermon conſiſting of judgement: he ſingeth a mournfull ſong, foretelling them of their full and final deſtruction. Secondly, the effect of his preaching in the reſidue of the Chap. The preaching of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> is a fearfull threatning of a fearful overthrow to come upon them <hi>for their wickedneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the threatning.</note> 
                     <hi>which was come up before the Lord,</hi> &amp; did cry for vengeance to heaven, Chap. 1, 2. In this denunciation we may obſerve ſundry circumſtances,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to paſſe over the beginning of the verſe: firſt, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the time to come; <hi>forty dayes</hi> are limited for their repentance, as the dayes of Gods patience, which once expired they muſt looke for ſuddaine deſtruction. Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the circumſtance of time already paſt, implied in the word (Yet) putting them in remembrance, that he had already ſpared them a long time, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance. As if the Lord ſhould have ſaid by his Prophet, I have ſpared you long enough already, that I might juſtly poure
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21898:9"/>upon you all my wrath; yet nevertheleſſe I will ſpare you a little longer. Thirdly, the ſubject of the judgement,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Nineveh,</hi> a great, a mightie, a populous and proud Citie, whereby alſo are underſtood the inhabitants thereof from the greateſt to the leaſt and loweſt of them. Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the meaſure or quantitie of the judgement, an utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw not of one perſon or one family, but of the whole Citty: now whether it were by ſword, or famine, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, or by fire from heaven as God overthrew <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>And Ionah began to enter, &amp;c.</hi> Albeit the Lord might forthwith have deſtroyed the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> yet he giveth them ſome time of repentance, and ſendeth his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet unto them; which declareth the infinite and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe patience of God even toward theſe Infidels that knew him not, neither called upon his name, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. Firſt let us obſerve the generall doctrine out of the whole threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and afterward come to the particulars. Before the Lord would utterly deſtroy the City, he raiſed up <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> the Prophet, to foretell their deſtruction.
<label type="milestone">

We reade that the world was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by water: and it ſhall bee deſtroyed againe by fire.

<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.10.</note> when <hi>the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heate, the earth alſo and the workes that are therein ſhall bee burnt up,</hi> God hath not left us ignorant, but in diverſe places hath plainely ſet it downe unto us.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:21898:10"/>
                  <p>The reaſons of this courſe and order of Gods dealing, who warneth before he ſmiteth, are eyther in reſpect of God, or in reſpect of the godly, or in reſpect of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In reſpect of God, to juſtifie his proceedings and judgements with men even before the ſonnes of men: to ſtop the mouth of iniquitie, that it might have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to object or plead againſt him, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36.15. <hi>Ier.</hi> 25.3.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and 35.15. Secondly, in reſpect of the godly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee would not take his people at unwares, who is friendly unto them, and loveth them as his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Now it were the part of an enemy, and not of a friend to come upon them &amp; ſurpriſe them at unwares, as they doe that come to aſſault a Citty; and therefore God to ſhew his favour and friendſhip to them that are his, doth foretell and give them warning before hand, that ſo they might happily prevent it <hi>by their repentance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.9.</note> and thereby have judgements kept from them.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in reſpect of the ungodly themſelves, becauſe God would have thoſe that are none of his to be left without excuſe, that they might not be able to accuſe God of any unjuſt dealing, or murmure againſt him, for as much as they had warning, but would not bee warned; they heard of his judgements, but they would not judge themſelves; neither labour to prevent them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.14. therefore the damnation of ſuch is juſt.</p>
                  <p>Vſe 1.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Behold from hence the wonderfull mercy, goodneſſe and patience of our good God, whoſe manner is alwaies to give warning before hee proceede in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He ſeeketh not to take any at advantage, neither deſireth hee the death of a ſinner: And therefore the Prophet ſaith,
<note place="margin">Lam. 3.33.36.</note> 
                     <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men: to cruſh under his feet all the priſoners of the earth, to ſubvert a man in his cauſe, the Lord approveth not, Lam.</hi> 3.33.36. He would have none to periſh that are his, but all to repent and to be ſaved. He inſtructeth, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21898:10"/>he may not threaten: he threatneth, that he may not ſmite: he ſmiteth, that he may not deſtroy:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.32.</note> yea and ſometime he deſtroyeth temporally, that he may not deſtroy eternally. This is the courſe which he neede not obſerve; becauſe upon our owne perill, the perill of our ſoules, wee are bound to take heed of judgements to come, that wee ſhould prevent them before they come, He would have us to ſend out our Embaſſadours, which are our prayers, to treate of conditions of peace betweene God and us. Such as intend revenge and the execution of their wrath, are not wont to give warning, but to watch their oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, as we ſee in <hi>Abſolom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13.22.</note> 
                     <hi>who ſpake neither good nor evill</hi> to his brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> becauſe he hated him, and then ſuddenly, when his heart was merry with wine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be ſmitten. If God had a purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us as his enemies, and to come upon us at unwares, hee would never threaten us, and give us ſuch faire war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to avoyd the ſtroke of his ſword drawne out againſt us. For wherefore doth hee not deſtroy us? Is it for want of deſart on our part? No doubtleſſe: he findeth juſt cauſe to proceede againſt us, and hee is of infinite power to puniſh us. The Prophet teacheth,
<note place="margin">Num. 11.23. Eſay 59.1.</note> that <hi>his hand is not weakned as though he could not ſtrike us, neither is his arme ſhortned as though hee could not reach us, Eſa.</hi> 59.1. v.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if any man bee overtaken with any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he muſt know thus much, that certainely God was true, and that his purpoſe was, we ſhould prevent it, or elſe he would never have given warning of it. There is no man that can juſtly ſay, that the ſilence of God is the cauſe of his ſecurity: for Gods manner is, never to come with any judgement, and to diſcharge a whole vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſhot, but he alwayes ſendeth a warning peece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But you will ſay, we have no Prophets to foretell,
<label type="milestone">

                     </label> To this I make anſwer, as our Saviour ſaith of the rich man in the Goſpell, that his brethren had both <hi>Moſes and the Prophets among them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 16.29.31.</note> when indeed both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were all dead long before: but his meaning was, that they had the bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the writings of the Prophets before them. So may I ſay, that wee have the Prophets and Apoſtles ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, I meane we have the holy Scriptures, wherein are contained the workes of the Prophets and of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: and beſides theſe, God hath given to us his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that they might as it were put life againe into the dead Prophets, that they might open and declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us thoſe things which are doubtfull and obſcure: and therefore if any man be admoniſhed by theſe, that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall certainly come, let him take heed he withſtand not the Spirit of God, for it is as true and evident, as if the Prophets and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe were alive and uttered theſe threatnings; and it is the wonderfull goodneſſe of God, that hee will foretell us of his judgements, and after a ſort ſend them home to our owne hearts. Our conſciences tell us, that wee are guilty of thoſe ſinnes which have formerly beene reprooved, and whereof we have beene forewarned: let us therefore conclude with our ſelves, that it is the mercy of God, that hee doth threaten hell and judgements unto us, as well as promiſe heaven and happineſſe: and let us bleſſe his name in our hearts, that he hath granted ſuch a gracious warning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and endeavour to breake off our ſinnes, that ſo hee may bee pleaſed to proceede no farther with his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this dealing of God muſt provoke us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and to turne unto God,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4. 2 Pet. 3.13.</note> becauſe <hi>his patience ſerveth to leade us to repentance, Rom.</hi> 2.4. The daies of his patience laſt long, but they are not everlaſting, if we repent not. Let us meete him betimes, while hee is in the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     </note> a queſtion may bee demanded, how this threatning ſtandeth with the truth of God, and the iſſue and event of the matter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the end of this propheſy? to pronounce ſuch a dreadfull ſentence againſt a City and the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which tooke not that effect; or ſhall wee thinke that God changed his minde, to propoſe that which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not? and doth not the Scripture teach us, that he is unchangable, and no ſhaddow of turning with him? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the threatnings of God are oftentimes conditionall, though the condition be not expreſſed, as appeareth in the laſt verſe of the 3. Chapter:
<note place="margin">Chap. 3.10.</note>

<label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.14. &amp;c.</note> the effect will ceaſe: as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>If I ſay to the wicked, you ſhall dye the death; if he turne from his ſinne and doe that is lawfull and right, none of his ſinnes that he hath committed ſhall be mentioned,</hi>

                     <hi>he ſhall live and not die.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God is a God of long ſufferance and much patience, ready to forgive and receive to mercy, yea in judgement to remember mercy, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24, 16. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.2. when once we turne unto him,

                     </label> as God is one, ſo he hath but one will. Howbeit, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into that which is revealed and ſecret. The ſecret is of things hidde with himſelfe and not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, as <hi>Deutero.</hi> 29.29. The revealed is of things made knowne by the word and by daily experience. The ſecret will is without condition annexed unto it: the reveald is with condition, and it is joyned with exhortations, admonitions, inſtructions, and reprehenſions, as may beſt ſerve for mans ſalvation, and to keepe him in awe of God and his threatnings. The ſecret ſhall and muſt be accompliſhed, notwithſtanding all the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and gaineſaying of men and Angels,

A groſſe abuſe of God and his wil. For when they walked in their owne waies, as it were in by-paths, and followed their ſinfull luſts and pleaſures, did they ſet Gods will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes? or did they aſke counſell of him? or did they enter into ſuch practiſes with a purpoſe to doe his will?

                  <p>Secondly, it is the duty of all men in hearing the threatnings of God, to beware of all impediments and hindrances of repentance, for as much as they muſt take effect, unleſſe we obſerve the condition. If wee doe not keepe the condition, the threatning is abſolute, and ſurer than the heavens. Take heede therefore of theſe lets, which, as ſo many ſtumbling blockes, lye in our way to cauſe us to fall.
<note place="margin">Impediments hindring true repentance.</note> Firſt wee muſt not ſlight the threatnings of God, nor ſet light by them, as the manner of many is, who for the moſt part regard them no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 28.15.</note> than as if they <hi>had made a covenant with death, and were at league with hell,</hi> and not with God, to ſerve him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the daies of their life. Such were the ſonnes in law of <hi>Lot</hi> that ſhould have married his daughters; when they heard of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Sodome</hi> with fire and brimſtone, and were exhorted to ſave themſelves from that crooked gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to <hi>depart from the tents of thoſe wicked men, and to ſeparate themſelves from among that Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> leaſt they were conſumed with them: <hi>hee ſeemed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21898:13"/>as one that mocked</hi> unto his ſonnes in law,
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.14.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they periſhed in thoſe flames. Secondly, we muſt not exempt our ſelves from them, and poſt them over to others, or thinke they belong not at all to us,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 28.15</note> that <hi>albeit the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe through, it ſhall not come upon us, for wee have made lies our refuge, and under falſehood have wee hidde our ſelves, Eſa.</hi> 28.15. Theſe are they that hide their owne ſinnes like <hi>Adam,</hi> and turne them over to others, as hee did to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the woman to the Serpent, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 3. wee care not on whoſe ſhoulders wee lay the burthen; ſo that wee doe not beare it nor touch it with our little finger, neither who ſmart for it, ſo that wee be free and doe not beare it. Thus wee flatter our ſelves, and never lay his threatnings to heart, untill his judgements fall full up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our heads, as they did upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, bee not deceived to thinke by riches,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or honour, by power or pollicy, by favour or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to fave and deliver our ſelves from the puniſhments of God; whereas nothing ſhall prevaile with him, nothing in the world, but repentance and turning from ſinne, hating and forſaking it. True it is, in the courts and conſiſtories of men, theſe may beare ſway and get the upper hand; a man may eſcape by his purſe, or winde himſelfe out of trouble by might of men, and ſo avoyd the danger of the Law: but it is not ſo with God. For howſoever men uſe to reaſon, I care not, I will doe well enough, as long as I have money and friends: howbeit this will not ſerve to free us from Gods Plagues and puniſhments, as <hi>Zeph.</hi> I.
<note place="margin">Zeph. 1.18.</note> When God had threatned to conſume all things from off the Land, both man and beaſt, leaſt they ſhould imagine by their wealth or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiles to eſcape, hee ſaith, <hi>Neither their</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21898:14"/>ſilver, nor their gold ſhall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lords wrath. Fourthly, delay not the time, nor put off the threatnings, which the Lord abhorreth, as <hi>Ezek.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 12.22.23.</note> 12. Sonne of man, what is that proverbe that yee have in the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaying, The dayes are prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and every viſion faileth?

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> if God threaten and there follow no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, be well aſſured, that which he hath threatned ſhall come to paſſe.
<note place="margin">Gen. 15.16.</note>

<note place="margin">Rom. 11.20.21.</note> 
                     <hi>If God ſpared not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall branches, take heed, leaſt he alſo ſpare not thee: and if the branches were broken off through unbeleefe, let not us be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but feare.</hi> We heare the threatnings of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and his fearefull judgements publiſhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by his faithfull ſervants, but what repentance,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21898:14"/>what amendment followeth? May we not ſay with the Prophet, <hi>I hearkned and heard, but they ſpake not aright,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 8.6.7.</note> 
                     <hi>no man repented him of his wickedneſſe, ſaying, what have I done? every one turne to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battell, &amp;c.</hi> And is it not ſo in our times, nay rather is it not worſe? We are ſo farre from repentance and turning to God, that the Lord ſeemeth in his juſt judgement to have given us over and forſaken us, and to have blinded our eyes, to have ſtopped our eares, and to have hardned our hearts, leaſt we ſhould ſee with our eyes, and heare with our eares, and underſtand with our hearts, and ſhould returne and bee ſaved. Sometimes he doth take away his word utterly, and hee threatneth it as a grievous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the Iewes,
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.43.</note> 
                     <hi>The kingdome of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi> and we are aſſured of the accompliſhing thereof,

This is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret judgement, and therefore more ſharpe and greevous than the former, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 6. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay 6.10.</note> as they had fatted and fleſhed themſelves in ſinne, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven glutted themſelves in iniquity: <hi>make their eares hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> as they had ſtopped and ſtuffed them with vanity, that the word could not enter: <hi>and ſhut their eyes,</hi> as they had drowſie and ſleepy eyes, and had cloſed the eyes of their bodies, ſo God threatneth to ſhut the eyes of their minds, as men benummed and paſt feeling, leaſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and convert, and be healed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as it is with the threatnings of God, ſo on the other ſide it is with his promiſes. We have many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and precious promiſes mentioned in the word, ſome of this life ſome of the life to come; ſome temporall, and

Seeing this is true, that God will bring deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a land for ſinne, then have we cauſe to feare, that the day of our deſolation and of our mourning is not farre off. For ſeeing it hath beene proved, that wee are growne to the hight of wickedneſſe, both in the manner by breaking all the bounds that God hath ſet to keepe us, and alſo in the meaſure by adding ſinne unto ſinne: then certainely in the next place what can be expected, but that our land ſhould mourne, and deſtruction come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.1.2.</note> as paine upon a woman in travaile? <hi>becauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land, but by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and committing adultery they breake out, and blood toucheth blood.</hi> And if God deſtroy his owne people and other nations, and roote them out for the ſame ſinnes that ſway and ſwarme among us, filling all places, and abounding in all perſons every where; what can we looke for, but that wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame weight of ſinnes, ſhould alſo have the ſame waight of judgement?

Is it not all one altogether to be abſent, and to be thus preſent?</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it ſerueth for information. Firſt, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great comfort for the loſt ſheepe of Chriſt, ſtraying from the ſheepefold, to underſtand, that there is a way
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21898:21"/>left to recover wandering ſinners, which is the hearing of the word, and thereby to come to ſaluation. Secondly, it is a ſpeciall bleſſing to live in ſuch places and among ſuch people, where the word is taught, and where they may be partakers of hearing. Happy are they that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the ſaving doctrine of the Goſpell with a deſire to underſtand it, and care to obey it. But wofull and feareful is their eſtate that live in ſuch barraine places, where the dearth of the word pineth away the ſoule; we may ſay of them in deed and in truth,
<note place="margin">Num. 13.32.</note> 
                     <hi>They are lands that eate up the inhabitants, thereof: and in that day ſhall the faire virgins and young men faint for thirst.</hi> Thirdly it teacheth, that the ſenſe of hearing is a great and neceſſary bleſſing of God, and therefore fitly called the ſenſe of underſtanding and of beleeving. True it is, God can worke without, and no doubt he doth: true it is alſo that our other ſenſes are good helpes of many notable things, eſpecially the eyes are ſpeciall furtherers of knowledge. God hath two bookes whereby he teacheth us, and wherein we reade his marueilous wiſedome; the one,

For there is no other ordinary meanes under heaven to conuert ſinners, and to worke faith in us, than the Miniſtery of the word. How then can we learne what true faith and true repentance is, without the word? Without which we muſt periſh and be condemned.

Fiftly, all ſuch as through negligence, careleſneſſe, contempt, and wilfulneſſe refuſe the hearing of the word, doe caſt from them the meanes of their ſalvation, and forſake their owne mercies; nay, they renounce faith and turning to God, and account themſelues unworthy of eternall life.

                  <p>Laſtly,

                     <note place="margin">Mar. 4.24. Luk. 8.18.</note> it is our duty to take heed how we heare. For it ſtandeth us vpon to regard not onely what we heare, but how we heare, and to looke to the manner as well as to the matter. For we may periſh as well by not hearing aright, as by hearing that which is not right: and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it is not enough to heare the truth, but we muſt heare truly. That we may attaine to this, we muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme theſe ſeuerall duties, to attend unto it, to marke it, to underſtand it, to hold it faſt, and laſtly to apply it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt point required of us,
<note place="margin">The firſt duty of hearers.</note> is, that we attend &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto it diligently. It is not ſufficient to heare. It is one thing to heare, but hearkning and giuing eare is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing. To heare requireth no more but the eares of the body: to hearken requireth the eares of the mind. Hence it is, that Chriſt ſaith <hi>Math.</hi> 13. <hi>He that hath eares to heare,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 13.9.</note> 
                     <hi>let him heare.</hi> Where he ſheweth, that there is a double hearing, outward and inward, or elſe he would never charge and admoniſh theſe that had eares to heare
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21898:22"/>and came to the houſe of God to heare, that they ſhould be carefull to heare: ſhewing that a man may heare, and yet if he take not heed be as a deafe man, and do no more good than a deafe man that heareth nothing; it is all one as if he wanted eares, or were as a ſtocke or a ſtone, nay it had beene better he had never heard at all, becauſe by his hearing he heapeth up the greater judgement and the deeper condemnation. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prouerb.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 4.20. and 8.32.34.</note> 4. <hi>My ſonne attend to my words, incline thine eares vnto my ſayings:</hi> and Chap. 8. <hi>Hearken unto me, bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſtes of my doores.</hi> This is called the inclining of the eare to wiſedome, <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.2. Let it not then be with us as with the multitude and the greateſt ſort, who ſuppoſe it to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to heare, though they do no more; but it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us to liſten &amp; give eare, nay both our eares to God. Let it be with us in performing this duty as it is with worldly minded men, when they heare of ſome good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or matter of gaine and profit, they raiſe and rouſe up themſelues inſtantly, and lift up their eares, they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken very diligently and carefully. Or let us deale as ſuch perſons doe, who being preſent and hearing ſome what ſpoken, do thinke that others ſpeak of them: O how will they bow forward and incline their bodies, how wil they put their eares neere and cloſe to them, to heare (if it be poſſible) what they ſay; yea ſometimes would give much to know what they ſpeake. Thus let us doe, wee ſhould never heare the word, but thinke the Miniſter ſpeaketh not onely to us, but of us, and ſay to our owne hearts, This is a word concerning me: this is for my good and profit, this will bring to me the greateſt gaine: I muſt therefore incline mine eare, attentively, and liſten unto it duly and diligently. If any aske what is the reaſon, and whence it commeth, that one hath an hearing eare, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hath a dull and deafe care; the holy Scripture telleth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21898:23"/>us and teſtifieth,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not require, mine eares haſt thou opened.</hi> This is the eare-marke whereby we are knowne to be in the number of the ſheepe of Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. No man can make and frame to himſelfe ſuch ſanctified eares by his owne wit and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but they muſt be prepared and given to us of the Lord, and to him we muſt returne the praiſe and glory.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond duty is to marke and regard what we heare.
<note place="margin">The ſecond duty of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> How many are there that heare &amp; attend, yet never once marke nor regard any thing what hath beene ſpoken and delivered: for if they did, they could not be ſo ignorant &amp; blinde as they are. Life and death is ſet before us: life to our ſalvation, if it be embraced; death to our condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if it be rejected; but the moſt ſort regard neither the one nor the other. Hence it is, that our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing his Diſciples, warneth them, that whoſoever <hi>readeth muſt conſider what he readeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 24 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 24. The palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ignorance that abideth in our aſſemblies ſpringeth from this fountaine, that we never weigh with our ſelues what we have heard, neither call our ſelues to an account at any time what we have learned.</p>
                  <p>The third duty is to underſtand what we have heard.
<note place="margin">The third duty of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> For to heare and not to underſtand is as if we heard not at all, or as if we heard a ſtrange language. Hence it is, that our Saviour after his teaching examineth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples what they had learned and how they had profited,
<note place="margin">Math. 13.51.</note> 
                     <hi>Have ye underſtood all theſe things?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act 8.30.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſaid vnto him, yea Lord.</hi> So <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Eunuch, Vnderſtandeſt thou what thou readest?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.9.11.13.14.</note> ſhewing thereby, that reading and hearing, and praying, or whatſoever we doe without knowledge and underſtanding, is nothing worth, it is as ſounding braſſe or as a tinkling Cimball. And in the deſcription of the good and ſaving hearers, it is ſaid, they heare the word and <hi>underſtand</hi> it, and beare fruit: ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring forth fruite without underſtanding the word.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21898:23"/>So then right hearers are underſtanding hearers. How many have we that are hearers? but how few, that we can truely ſay of them, they be underſtanding hearers? Theſe profit nothing, alwayes learning, and never attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to any ſound knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The fourth duty, is to hold faſt what we have heard,
<note place="margin">The fourth dutie of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Pro. 2.1. 2 King. 7.8.</note> marked, and underſtood, we muſt lay it, nay locke it up cloſely and ſafely in the heart as in a cloſet, as <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. <hi>receive my wordes, and hide my Commandments within thee;</hi> we muſt doe as the Lepers did, when they had ſiluer and gold and much treaſure, they went and hid it, and carried it away. The word of God is a precious treaſure, the merchandiſe thereof is better than ſiluer, and the gaine thereof is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than fine gold, We ſhould therefore both hold it faſt, and hide it ſafe. The Apoſtle exhorteth us,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.1.</note> that we ought to <hi>give the more diligent heed to the things which wee have heard, leaſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlippe from us:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 3.11.</note> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.11. <hi>hold faſt that which thou haſt, till I come, that no man take thy crowne from thee.</hi> We muſt commit good inſtructions to memory. We uſe not to lay up Iewels &amp; precious ſtones looſely and careleſly abroad; had we rich treaſure, we would not lay it up negligently, but keepe it under locke and key: We ſhould not let holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inſtructions ſlip out of our minde and memory, but hold them faſt and firme in our remembrance. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth ſuch as heare the word, but it is with ſuch dull, deafe, and drouſie eares, that it is no ſooner in at the one eare, but by and by it is out at the other. Thus it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that through the negligence of the hearer, the labour and doctrine of the ſpeaker is utterly loſt.
<note place="margin">The fift duty of the hearers.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt duty is to apply to our ſelues what we have heard, a notable meanes to ſtrengthen memory, and to hold faſt that which is fading and falling away. For as a medicine, which is wholeſome and healthfull in it ſelfe, profiteth not the ſick perſons that doth deſpiſe and reject
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21898:24"/>it, and not apply it to himſelfe: ſo the hearing of the word, and receiving of the Sacraments, are all without fruit, if we doe not apply them to our ſelues, and by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation make them our owne. All hearing is no better than Hypocriſie without this. For it is with us as it is at a feaſt: So much is ours as we receaue and digeſt, it skilleth not what others doe, we are no way benefitted or bettered by it: So we have ſmall profit by that which others heare, except we apply it to our own ſoules.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this revenge conſiſteth in converting thoſe very things, which have beene the matter or object of ſinne, and abuſed by the fleſh to ſinne, to the ſeruice of God, &amp; to be the matter of our repentance; as the ſiluer &amp; gold that was abuſed to Idolatry, was afterward employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the worſhip of the true God. <hi>David</hi> in his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery defiled the mariage-bed; in his repentance <hi>he waſhed his bed with teares,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 6.6.</note> yea all night long he made it to ſwim. So the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that had uſed curious artes, when once they beleeued, came and confeſſed and ſhewed their

<note place="margin">Act. 19.19.</note> 
                     <hi>eſteemed to be worth fifty thouſand pieces of ſiluer.</hi> And as the Iſraelites had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned greeuouſly in offering their earings of gold to make therewith a Calfe; ſo repenting of their Idolatry,
<note place="margin">Exod. 35.22.</note> they offered likewiſe gold and earings to the Tabernacle wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, <hi>whoſe heart made them willing to bring an offering to the Lord,</hi> untill there was more then enough, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36.5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when with the ſame members and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our bodies,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which the fleſh moſt of all hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to ſinne and wickedneſſe, wee in ſpeciall ſort ſeeke and endeauour to glorifie God. <hi>Zachariah</hi> the Prieſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his mouth in giving God the lie, whiles hee beleeved not the Angell ſent unto him, that God would give him a ſonne: but ſo ſoone as hee could ſpeake (for he was ſtriken dumbe) he glorified God with <hi>his mouth and praiſed his name, Luk.</hi> 1.
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.64.</note> So the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which is thought to have abuſed her eyes, her haire, his lippes to wantonneſſe and uncleanneſſe (for ſhe was a greevous ſinner) when ſhe repented, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged her ſelfe upon the fleſh, in ſhewing her love to Chriſt; ſhe ceaſed not to kiſſe his feet, to waſh them with the teares of her eyes, and to wipe them with the haires of her head. O how happy were it for ſuch, as have uſed their tongues to deceit, whoſe mouthes have beene full of curſing and blaſphemy, &amp; their throate an open ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, if they would circumciſe their lips, and make their tongues their glory to glorifie the name of God! that whereas they have curſed bitterly,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.29.</note> now they may learne to bleſſe graciouſly, that our communication may <hi>be good to the uſe of edifying,</hi> and miniſter grace unto the hearers: And ſuch as have had feet ſwift to ſhed blood, &amp; to carry them to places of vanity and impiety, of drunkenneſſe and uncleanneſſe, happy were it if they would take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of themſelues, and uſe their feet to carry them into

                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> we take revenge on the fleſh, when we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes refraine ourſelves, and bridle our affections from the uſe of things otherwiſe lawfull, becauſe we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended therein. As if we have offended in gluttony and drunkenneſſe, we ſhould puniſh our ſelues with faſting and abſtinence from ſtrong drinke: as we take knives, from children, when they cannot uſe them without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of themſelues.</p>
                  <p>The laſt point of this revenge is, when we upbraid the fleſh and caſt it in the teeth with thoſe afflictions which God ſendeth, as the wages of ſinne. For though we may not draw puniſhments upon our ſelues to mortifie the fleſh, yet when God impoſeth them upon us for our good, we ſhould make benefit and advantage thereof, and inſult over the fleſh, and triumph over it when God puniſheth it, rating and checking it as the cauſe of all our ſmart: Ah, thou vile fleſh, I may thanke thee for all this paines and ſorrow, I could not turne thee, but I hope God will now tame thee: I could not convert thee, but I truſt God will now evert thee and turne thee quite out of dores: thou liftedſt up thy ſelfe aloft, but God will bring thee under, thou rebell. Thus we ſhould joyne with God, helpe him to whip our ſinnes harder and oftner by taking his part, juſtifie him in all his dealings, drive his chaſticementes home to our hearts as the nailes to the head, and impute all the cauſes of our afflictions to our ſelues. If we would try our repentance by this revenge, and our revenge by theſe few notes, alas where ſhall we find the repentance that is required among the greateſt number! doe we mortifie our beloved ſinnes, or are they as bitter as gall and wormewood unto us? doe we turne thoſe things, times, and place which we have abuſed to ſinne, to be matters and witneſſes of our repentance? doe we turne
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21898:27"/>thoſe members of our bodies abuſed to ſinne, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe? or doe we bridle and reſtraine our ſelves from ſuch things wherein wee have offended? No doubtleſſe, theſe are farre from us, and therefore we from repentance.</p>

                     <hi>A faſt, and put on ſackcloth.)</hi> Thus much generally is to be obſerued from the practiſe of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> that revenged themſelues of their exceſſe and ſuperfluity by faſting and ſackcloth: now we are to ſpeake of faſting in particular. But firſt of all let us ſet downe the doctrine. We learne,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                     </label> that publike faſting was alwayes wont to be ſanctified and appointed among Gods people in times of dangers either preſent or imminent.
<note place="margin">Publike faſter were alwayes called and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in times of danger.</note> This is confirmed by ſundry precepts, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.29. <hi>This ſhall be a ſtatute for ever unto you, in the ſeventh mouth, on the tenth day of the moneth, ye ſhall afflict your ſoules by a ſtatute for ever.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> chap. 2.15.16. <hi>Blow the Trumpet in Zion, ſanctifie a faſt, call a ſolemne aſſembly, gather the people, ſanctifie the Congregation, aſſemble the Elders, gather the Children and thoſe that ſucke the breaſt, &amp;c.</hi> ſee how he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth ſundry commandements together, binding the Prieſts, the people, the Congregation, the Elders, the children, the married, that is, all ſortes, high and low, young and old, one and other. The truth of this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeareth by ſundry examples of ſuch as have gone before us in this practiſe. <hi>Ezra</hi> the good Scribe of the Lord, and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the religious governour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, faſted and all that were under their charge, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8.21 <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.1.
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.3</note> So <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> ordained <hi>a faſt throughout all Iudah,</hi> when the enemies upon a ſuddaine had broken into the borders of his kingdome: hee knew no way better how to reſiſt them, and drive them backe than this, which he found ſtronger than the ſword of the mighty: and ſo ſhall we find praying and faſting ſtronger to withſtand the infection and to call the heauy hand of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21898:28"/>God gone out againſt us, and ſtriking downe many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of us, than all the rules and receites, the meanes and medicines which the wiſeſt Phyſitions can preſcribe, if we performe it aright,
<note place="margin">Exod. 17.11. 1 Sam. 7.9.10.</note> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. the ſword of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> was not ſo forcible as the praier of <hi>Moſes; for while he held up his hands Iſrael prevailed, and when he let downe his hands, Amalek prevailed.</hi> True it is, good meanes are neither to be deſpiſed nor neglected, for that were to tempt God, and to ſtrengthen the enemy; howbeit <hi>of themſelues</hi> they profit little, the greateſt power and ſtrength lyeth in prayer which ſanctifieth our faſting.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may underſtand the doctrine of faſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
<note place="margin">What we muſt do to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the doctrine of faſting aright. what a faſt is.</note> and ſo be directed the better in the practiſe thereof, let us conſider theſe fiue points, what it is, what be the kindes thereof, the parts, the reaſons, and laſtly the uſes. The firſt point is, what it is. Faſting is an abſtinence from all meates and drinkes, from euen to even, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, to teſtifie our ſolemne repentance, and to make our praiers more effectuall. I call this an abſtinence from all meates and drinkes, as appeareth plainely in this Chap. <hi>Let neither man nor beaſt taste any thing, let them not feed nor drinke water,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.35.</note> verſ. 7. The ſame ſpeakth <hi>David,</hi> when he faſted for the murthering of <hi>Abner,</hi> who was ſlaine by the ſword of <hi>Ioab, God doe ſo to me and more alſo, if I taſte bread or ought elſe, til the ſunne be down.</hi> Many there are that pretend a ſolemne faſting, when indeed they doe nothing leſſe: ſuch diſſimulation there is with God &amp; man. Better it were never to keepe a faſting, than to obſerue ſuch a mocke faſt: for their faſting is eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let us not faſt in ſhew, and feed in ſecret; neither make profeſſion of one thing, and practiſe another. I adde in the deſcription, <hi>from even to even,</hi> that is, for an whole day. This we ſaw in the example of <hi>David</hi> before, who faſted till the Sunne went downe. And 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.24. they muſt not eate bread untill evening. So the Iſraelites
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21898:28"/>having received two great loſſes, doe humble themſelues and gather themſelues together into the houſe of the Lord. <hi>They wept, and ſate downe before the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iudg. 20.16.</note> 
                     <hi>and faſted that day untill the evening;</hi> and the next day they prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt their enemies. Thus for the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and the ſlaughter of the people,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.12.</note> 
                     <hi>they likewiſe wept and faſted untill the evening,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. becauſe they were fallen with the ſword. And <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> after the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiture of Iſrael by the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the Arke of the Lord,
<note place="margin">Ioſh. 7.6.</note> 
                     <hi>untill the eventide, he and the Elders of Iſrael,</hi> and put duſt upon their heads. Thus we ſee the time how long we are reſtrained, to keepe as in a meane between too much and too little. The next point is, that it is commanded of God. This we ſaw before; and this maketh a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene humane faſtes (of which we ſhall ſpeake in the next point) and this that is a Divine inſtitution. So then faſting is not a will-worſhip, nor deviſe of man, but an Ordinance of God. The next point is, that it ſerueth to make profeſſion of our repentance, and ſo to be a meanes to worke in us the greater humiliation. Hence it is, that it is called <hi>the humbling of the ſoule,</hi> or an afflicting thereof,
<note place="margin">Levit. 23.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Numb,</hi> 29.7. to ſeeke of him a right way for us, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8.21. and it was evermore joyned with praier, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6.
<note place="margin">Numb 29.7.</note> they faſted on that day, and ſaid there,
<note place="margin">Luk. 2.37.</note> We have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord: and <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. it is ſaid of <hi>Anna</hi> the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe, <hi>ſhe departed not from the Temple, but ſerued God with faſting and prayers night and day.</hi> This is the life of our faſting, when we make it as the wing of prayer, wherby more ſwiftly we make it fly up to heaven and pierce the cloudes, and enter into the preſence of God. Therefore the laſt part of the deſcription is, that it ſerueth to maks our prayers more earneſt and effectuall, as verſe. 7. <hi>Let neither man nor beaſt feed nor drinke water, but cry mightily unto God.</hi> For as fulneſſe maketh us more unfit, dul, heavy,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21898:29"/>ſleepy, and conſequently untoward to every good worke: ſo this abſtinence quickneth our zeale, feeling, faith, and every good worke.</p>
                  <p>So then touching the nature of Faſting,
<note place="margin">Faſting hath the nature of a Sabbath.</note> from all theſe points joyntly conſidered, we learne that it hath the nature of a Sabbath, becauſe at ſuch time &amp; ſeaſons we are bound to abſtaine not onely from meates and drinkes, but no leſſe from our ordinary labours, profits, and pleaſures; even ſuch as at other times are lawfull, become now unlawfull. Wherefore as the Lord commandeth to ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, ſo he commandeth to ſanctifie a faſt, and threatneth that whoſoever ſhall doe any worke at all therein, even on that day,
<note place="margin">Levit. 16.31. &amp; 23.30.31.</note> ſhall be cut off from among his people, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. <hi>Becauſe it ſhall be a Sabbath of reſt,</hi> and we ought to reſort at ſuch ſolemne times to the houſe of God, no leſſe than we ought to doe on the Sabbath, if not rather more, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the urging and preſſing occaſion, <hi>Iudge.</hi> 20. Hereby then falleth to the ground the opinion of ſuch as hold it neither needfull nor expedient, that the word ſhould be preached at ſuch times as the Church aſſembleth for faſting and praying. Theſe are not aſhamed to affirme, that they have often heard and read of the exerciſe of faſting and praying, but never of faſting and preaching; as if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth the time were ſpent unprofitably that is ſpent that way. Theſe men would gladly ſay ſomewhat to maintaine and countenance their owne idleneſſe. And becauſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of others maketh their negligence to appeare the greater, they open their mouthes againſt them and their practiſe who preach the word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon according to the Commandement of God and man, and ſpeake all manner of evill of them. The wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21898:29"/>workes: but the preaching of the word is the principall and ſpeciall meanes to worke theſe in vs: and what is what is all our faſting without true repentance? doubtleſſe there is no life in it, and therefore at ſuch times the word ſhould be taught, to make the reſt of the workes more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Beſides, we have ſhewed, that it hath the nature of a Sabbath day. Whatſoever therefore they were forbidden on the Sabbath, was likewiſe forbidden on the day of faſting; and whatſoeven they were then Commanded to do, ought likewiſe to be done and practiſed on this day. But the Apoſtle teacheth,
<note place="margin">Act. 15.21.</note> that <hi>Moſes hath in every City them that preach him, being read in the Synagogue every Sabbath day.</hi> So then, beſides that every day of faſting was a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, we ſee that after <hi>Moſes</hi> was read he was alſo preached: but he was read in their aſſemblies on the daies of their faſting, <hi>Neh</hi> 9.13. there he ſheweth how they ſpent that day: one fourth part they reade in the booke of the Lord their God, an other fourth part they ſpent in prayer and confeſſing their ſinnes to God, and by all likelihood, the other two parts were ſpent in preaching after they had read the Lecture of the Law: which is not expreſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſo lately and largely ſpoken thereof in the former chapter. And ſeeing they ſpent not the reſidne of the day idly, but in ſome holy exerciſe together, and neither in reading, nor in praying, how ſhould it be ſpent but in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching &amp; hearing the word of the Lord? Thus <hi>Anna</hi> ſerued the Lord in the Temple <hi>with prayer &amp; fasting,</hi> where <hi>without all queſtion</hi> was the preaching of the word, as well as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reading. It is a deſperate cauſe that hath nothing to pretend. It is objected, that the preaching of the word at ſuch times is never expreſſed, neither urged by Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; nor Commended by example. But we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the uſuall manner of the Scripture, by one part of the worſhip of God to underſtand the whole. For ſometimes there is mention of faſting, but not at all of prayer, <hi>Ester.</hi> 4.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21898:30"/>and often elſewhere. What then, ſhall we collect and conclude from hence that they praied not to God, nor once lifted up their hearts to him? The brute beaſtes may keepe ſuch a faſt, and therefore more muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood then is named.
<note place="margin">Eſay. 56.7. Math. 21.13.</note> So the Temple was called <hi>the houſe of praier;</hi> we never reade it called the houſe of preaching: and yet it ſerueth no leſſe for the one then for the other. But theſe men conceive and imagine, there is ſome time wherin the preaching of the word is unſeaſonable. Laſtly if the preaching of the word were uſed in times of holy feaſting &amp; ſolemne thankſgiving to be rendred unto God for ſome extraordinary bleſſings or deliverances receiued as in the Paſſeover, &amp; the like: why ſhould not the ſame exerciſe be much rather take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> up, when the times of holy faſting are ſanctified? that as at the one we might be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to praiſe God for his mercies, ſo at the other we might be moved to fear his judgments ready to fal upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>us.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point is the kindes and ſorts of faſting. This we muſt learne,
<note place="margin">The ſeverall ſorts of faſts.</note> to the end we may know of what faſt the Prophet ſpeaketh. For all faſtes are not of one nature, neither undertaken for one and the ſame cauſe. There is a faſt preſcribed by the Phyſition, to reſtore health,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or to procure appetite, abſtaining from ſuſtenance to conſume raw and ſuperfluous humours. The cauſe of this is repletion. Hence ariſeth this rule of theirs, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever diſeaſes faſting or emptineſſe cannot take away, cure them by medicine.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> An other is, to performe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with haſte and expedition, when the minde is ſo ſet upon ſome earneſt buſineſſe, that a man either forgetteth himſelfe, or elſe can intend no time to take his ſuſtenance and the refreſhing which nature otherwiſe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.24.</note> Such was the faſt commanded by <hi>Saul,</hi> who had no religious reſpect therein, but aymed at this, to ſpare no time from purſuing his enemies. Such was <hi>Pauls</hi> faſt and of the reſt that were in the ſhip with him,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> There is a faſt of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſobriety, which is nothing elſe but an uſing frugality in meates and drinkes, or the vertue of temperance, and is to be practiſed of us all the daies of our lives, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the warning of our Saviour,

Nay, we have beene ſo farre from having a wofull and wretched experience of theſe things, that moe among us have deſtroyed themſelues through ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting and drunkenneſſe &amp; wantonneſſe, than have dyed through want: moe have periſhed by riot, exceſſe, and ſuperfluity, than through penury and neceſſity. This commeth to paſſe through the abuſe of our long peace, and the contempt of the Goſpell. The Goſpell bringeth peace, peace bringeth plenty, plenty breadeth prodigality, &amp; prodigality bringeth penury: and therfore <hi>Moſes</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Iſraelites, when they ſhould enter into <hi>goodly cities which they builded not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 6.10.11.12.</note> 
                     <hi>houſes full of all good things which they filled not, welles digged which they digged not, vineyards and Olive trees which they planted not, then they muſt beware leaſt they forget the Lord their God.</hi> For if ever we forget God, it is when we are full, that is, when we have greateſt cauſe to remember him. Beſides the former kindes, there is likewiſe a faſt from ſinne: this is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual abſtinence, a ſacrifice which eſpecially pleaſeth God, conſiſting in the holineſſe of our lives, which we muſt keepe all the dayes of our lives. Of this the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Is not this the faſt that I have choſen, to looſe the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> There is alſo a miraculous faſt above nature. Of this we have three examples in holy Scripture, one of <hi>Moſes,</hi> at the publication of the Law; one of <hi>Elias,</hi> at the reſtitution of the Law; another of Chriſt Ieſus our Saviour at his inauguration and entrance into his office. This the Church of Rome after an apiſh imitation hath taken up: and that which he did once on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all his life, as if they meant to go beyond him, they make annuall or yearely. Hee abſtained from all meates and drinkes, they celebrate a counterfeit faſting, which may better be called a feaſting.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The laſt ſort is a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Chriſtian faſt, when we unfainedly humble our ſelues before the Lord, and judge our ſelues that we may eſcape his judgement. Of this we ſpeake in this place, and this we have before deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>This faſting hath two parts: one outward,
<note place="margin">The parts of faſting both outward and inward.</note> the other inward, helped forward by the outward. The outward is called <hi>a bodily exerciſe,</hi> which is an abſtinence for a time from the profits and pleaſures of this life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make us apter and fitter to the inward vertues. Theſe are either generall belonging to all, as abſtinence from food both meate and drinke, ſo farre as humane infirmity ſuffereth: provided if we cannot, that we doe it ſparingly, privately, without giving offence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending a neceſſity where there is none. Be not deceived, God will not be mocked. If he inable us to abſtaine, and we doe diſable our ſelues; if we make ſhew of faſting, and doe nothing leſſe, he will find us out, and we ſhall beare our condemnation whoſoever we be. For better it were not to faſt at all, then thus to diſſemble and play the notable hypocrites with God and man. I leave ſuch therefore to the judgement of God, and the checke
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21898:32"/>of their owne conſcience. But as we ſay commonly, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hath no law, where God inableth not to beare out this hard exerciſe, let them in the feare of God take ſome ſhort refreſhing. For theſe outward exerciſes were inſtituted to make us fitter to better duties, not to make us unfitter: that the fleſh ſhould be tamed, not killed:
<note place="margin">Dometur caro, ſed non inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imatur, Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> above ordinary cuſtome, but not beyond the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man. But beſides this abſtinence from food, it is as neceſſary that we abſtaine from bravery in apparell, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.4. <hi>Eſter.</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.1. and from the workes and labours of our daily callings, much more therefore from pleaſures and paſtimes, and from exceſſive meaſure of ſleeping, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 1.13. that we may have no occaſions or allurements to reioyce in the fleſh, and ſo to withdraw and withhold us from the ſolemne worſhip of God. We have ſuch among us as will ſeeme willing &amp; more forward then many of their fellowes, and would account themſelues wronged to be accounted contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of holy things; who notwithſtanding when they ſhould make preparation to ſo high and holy a worke, are buſie about their owne workes, or, which is all one, about their maſters: and when they ſhould uſe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after praying and preaching ended, they runne every one after the luſtes of his owne heart. I can learne no otherwiſe out of the Law of God, but theſe may as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully follow their labours upon the Sabbath, as upon the day of faſting: let theſe looke in what Schoole they have learned farther liberty.
<note place="margin">Ezod 20.8. Ioel. 2.15. Levit. 16.29.30.31.</note> For the ſame Lord that ſaith <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi> the Lords day, ſaith alſo <hi>Sanctifie a faſt:</hi> he that chargeth not to doe any worke on the Sabbath, chargeth likewiſe to do no worke at all on the day of faſting: he that hath reſtrained ſonne and daughter, man ſeruant, maid ſeruant, and the ſtranger that is within the gates from labour on the Sabbath, hath alſo forbbidden to every <hi>one all manner of worke, whether it be one of your owne
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21898:32"/>Country, or a ſtranger that ſoiourneth among you.</hi> Finally he that hath called the ſeventh day a Sabbath, hath alſo entituled the day of Faſt a <hi>Sabbath of reſt by a ſtatute for ever.</hi> If then we be aſhamed to follow the workes of our hands, and the courſe of our ordinary buſineſſe upon the Lords day, we ought alſo to be afraid to give up our ſelues to the labours of our callings upon our faſt-day, which ought with no leſſe religion to be obſerued then the other. But hereof more afterward. Theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon abſtinences belonging to all: there is one proper to the married couple, that they abſtaine from the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lawfull company one of an other,
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note> and <hi>the bed</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pronounced to be <hi>undefiled.</hi> The Prophet enioyneth <hi>the bridegroome</hi> to goe forth of his Chamber,
<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.16.</note> and <hi>the bride out of her cloſet;</hi> who notwithſtanding might iuſtly, if there were any, chalenge the greateſt priviledge. The wiſe man teaching, that to every thing there is a ſeaſon,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 3.5.</note> and a time to every purpoſe under the heaven, mentioneth <hi>a time to imbrace, and a time to refraine from imbracing.</hi> And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preſcribeth that they withdraw themſelues with mutuall conſent for a time,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.5.</note> 
                     <hi>that they may give themſelues to faſting and prayer.</hi> True it is <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 4.9.</note> that <hi>two are better than one,</hi> becauſe they have a good reward for their labour: but all this holy time of ſeparation, one is better then two, and he hath a better reward for his labour. It is the Apoſtles Precept, not to defraud one an other,
<note place="margin">Piaefraudes &amp; licita.</note> but now defrauding is both lawfull and laudable. This and all the other outward obſeruations, howſoever they may ſeeme childiſh, or at leaſt of ſmall importance to the naturall and carnall man, becauſe the Lord <hi>is a Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.24.</note> 
                     <hi>and will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth;</hi> and being in their owne nature indifferent, neither good nor evill, they can make us neither better nor worſe. Nevertheleſſe,
<note place="margin">The uſe and benefit of the outward parts.</note> theſe outward parts have their ſingular uſe and benefit, &amp; that in three reſpectes: for firſt, they are the ordinances of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21898:33"/>God who hath commanded them, and therefore they are not lightly to be eſteemed by the judgement of the ſenſes or outward man, that can go no farther then to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony it ſelfe; but according to the Scripture and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, which teacheth that God will bleſſe his own ordinances, and thereby worke his owne will, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken in a lively faith, and in his holy feare. What may ſeeme more ſimple and unſufficient to throw down the ſtrong walles of <hi>Iericho</hi> then the <hi>trumpets of Rammes hornes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioſh. 6.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>and the ſhout of the people</hi> with a loud voice? yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was Gods owne ordinance, it prevailed. What may ſeeme more weake, then the waſhing of <hi>Naaman</hi> in the waters of <hi>Iordan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Ring. 5.12.</note> to clenſe his Leproſie? <hi>were not Abana and Pharphar, the rivers of Damaſcus as good?</hi> Yet was it Gods appointment to heale him thereby.
<note place="margin">Iohn 9.6. Exod. 15.25. 2 King. 2.21.</note> Chriſt our Saviour made ſpittle and clay to annoynt the eyes of the blinde, <hi>and bad him goe to waſh in the poole of Siloam:</hi> a man might have thought this would rather have put out his eyes, then reſtored his ſight; Yet he went, and waſhed, and received ſight. God oftentimes worketh by weake meanes, and ſometimes by contrary, that the glory may not be of men,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7. Exod. 14.28.31. Ioſh. 6.21. Iudg. 7.4. Dan. 3. Ion. 2.</note> as he conveieth heavenly treaſures <hi>in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God.</hi> So then it is the manner of God to work ſometimes without meanes, ſometimes by weake meanes, ſometimes againſt meanes, and ſometimes above meanes, as pleaſeth him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This we ſee evidently in the Sacraments. Secondly, they that come to runne and wreſtle for a game were wont to abſtaine from all ſuch lettes as hinder their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.25.</note> and <hi>every one that striveth for maſtery,</hi> though it be to obtaine a corruptible Crowne, <hi>is temperate in all things,</hi> that may diſable them to performe the ſame with praiſe and commendation: and ſhall we thinke that the children of God, by abſtaining from ſuch things as he hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted them, ſhall not have a ſingular fruit and benefit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21898:33"/>the obtaining of an incorruptible crowne? Laſtly, the mouthes of the enemies are hereby ſtopped, if there were no other profit. For they chalenge the Goſpell to be a doctrine of liberty &amp; licentiouſneſſe in eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and that it cannot ſtand with the practiſe of faſting: why then ſhould we not ſtrive to ſtoppe the mouthes of ſuch as watch for our halting, and take away all occaſions from ſuch as ſeeke occaſions to ſpeake evill of our doctrine and profeſſion?</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the outward parts, the inward follow.
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> For <hi>the kingdome of God</hi> ſtandeth not in theſe outward things, it <hi>is not meate and drinke, but righteouſneſſe, and peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost:</hi> and therefore except we bring with us more then the externall exerciſes before mentioned, our faſting may be matched with the faſting of the beaſtes of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> for both they did eate nothing, and they were covered with ſackcloth: and if we doe no more, what priviledge have we above them? Wherefore we muſt conſider the inward vertues helped forward and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the outward and bodily exerciſes, as it is in the Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper.

Math. 9.15. 1 Sam. 7.6.</note> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts and manner of faſting, conſiſteth in foure things, humiliation, repentance, prayer, and confidence. The firſt is humiliation, never more neceſſary then at ſuch times, which conſiſteth in the ſight of our ſinnes, in the feeling of our miſery, in a bewayling of our vile eſtate, and an humble and particular confeſſion of all knowne ſinnes, without any reſeruation of any one.
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.22. Gen 21.17. Pſal. 147.9. &amp; 109.27.28. &amp; 145.15.16.</note> We muſt poure out the inward mourning of the heart witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſignified by the outward teares of the eyes. If this be wailing and lamentation be found in us, certainely he which heard the moane and mourning wrung from <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> in their extremity, he which heareth the cry of the young Ravens, &amp; the roaring of the Lyons that call upon him, will much rather heare the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21898:34"/>lamentation of his owne deare children which they make unto him in their miſery. This humiliation anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with good proportion and agreement to the outward parts: for thereby we confeſſe our ſelues unworthy of food, of reſt, of apparell, of life it ſelfe, or of any helpe &amp; comfort of this life.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part is repentance. The former penitency or humiliation and compunction of heart is the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke and foundation of true repentance, and maketh way for it as the needle doth for the threed. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in avoyding evill, and in doing good. This abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from evill is ſignified by our abſtinence from food, and it is the cheefe end of faſting. For what is our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing from meats and drinkes, if we doe not faſt from ſinne, but drinke in iniquity as water, like the fiſhes of the ſea?
<note place="margin">Eſay. 1.13. &amp; 58.4.</note> This was it that cauſed the Lord ſo often to reject the faſtes of the Iewes, becauſe they filled themſelues with all wickedneſſe, they faſted for ſtrife and debate. To abſtaine from ſuſtenance, and not to abſtaine from ſin, is the Devils faſt, it pleaſeth him, but not God. If then we deſire to approve our faſting to him, let us practiſe the workes of piety toward God, and that in the ſincerity of a good conſcience as in the ſight of God; and likewiſe the workes of Charity toward our brethren, forbearing one another and forgiving one another, remitting debtes to the pooreſt ſort that are no way able to pay, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in beſtowing almes upon ſuch as want releefe and fuſtenance.
<note place="margin">Eſay. 58.3.6.7. Zach. 7.9.10.</note> At leaſt let us beſtow ſo much as is ſpared by our abſtinence that day, leaſt under a pretence of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we practiſe miſerableneſſe, like thoſe that allow of this exerciſe to pinch the bellies of their labouring ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. Hence it is that Chriſt Ieſus joyned faſting and almes together in precept;
<note place="margin">Math. 6.23.16. Act. 10.30.31</note> and we muſt joyne them both together in practiſe, like <hi>Cornelius.</hi> He that doth not thus repent, doth not truly repent. If every mans faſting

                  <p>The third part is prayer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which we muſt make in time of faſting. No prayer, no true faſting, for faſting without it, is as a dead carcaſſe without life. This is one end of faſting to make our praiers more feruent and forcible. Hence it is,
<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.17.</note> that the Lord preſcribed a platforme of praier to the Prieſtes, the Miniſters of the Lord in the ſolemne aſſemblies of ſanctifying a faſt, <hi>Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach: that the heathen ſhould rule over them: wherefore ſhould they ſay among the people, where is their God?</hi> Theſe <hi>Ninevites,</hi> having but a ſhort warning, and a little light of knowledge knew thus much: for they proclaimed a faſt, that neither man, nor beaſt ſhould either eate or drinke: but they added with all, <hi>and cry mightily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, verſ.</hi> 8.
<note place="margin">Luk 2.37. Math. 17.21. Act. 10.30. 1 Cor. 7.5.</note> Thus did <hi>Anna</hi> ſerue God with faſtings and prayers, not with faſting alone, neither with prayers alone, but with both of them joyntly together. Neither is it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary prayer onely that ſhould be conceived at ſuch times, but as the occaſion of the Aſſembly is extraordinary, ſo ought our prayers to be. Thus therefore ought every one to rouſe up himſelfe to be feruent in prayer, and as faithfull remembrancers of the Lord to give him no reſt untill he heare us and grant our requeſtes. This prayer conſiſteth partly in confeſſing our ſpeciall ſinnes that have brought his judgments, craving pardon of them and beſeeching him to turne away his wrath and heavy diſpleaſure from us, and partly in asking ſuch things as are needfull for us.</p>
                  <p>The ſeverall ſorts of a religious faſt,
<note place="margin">The ſeverall reaſons and cauſes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and private faſtes.</note> which a man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to make his ſoule and body the fitter to pray more feruently to God, are theſe two, private and publike; to theſe I will joyne the ſeverall cauſes and reaſons wherefore they have beene taken in hand, which vary according to ſeverall occaſions. The private is which we ſanctifie in ſecret
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21898:35"/>and before God, for ſuch cauſes as our owne Conſciences beare record unto us.
<note place="margin">Math. 6.18.</note> Of this ſort our ſaviour ſpeaketh <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. We <hi>may not appear unto men to faſt, but unto our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in ſecret; &amp; the Father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhal reward us openly.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> practiſed, what time his child was ſtriken with mortall ſickneſſe, becauſe in the ſickneſſe of the child he did conſider the wrath and diſpleaſure of God againſt himſelfe, for the remooving whereof he <hi>faſted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.22.</note> 
                     <hi>mourned,</hi> and prayed, and never gave over, day nor night, untill ſuch time as he ſaw Gods will fulfilled by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the life of the child.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.10.</note> So did <hi>Hannah</hi> the wife of <hi>Elcanah, ſhe wept and did eate nothing,</hi> but <hi>in the bitterneſſe of heart</hi> ſhe prayed to the Lord.
<note place="margin">The cauſes of private faſts.</note> This is and hath beene un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, when a man becommeth an humble and earneſt ſuter for the pardon of ſome great and groſſe ſinne, that lyeth heavy upon the conſcience. Sometimes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of ſome ſinne, whereunto a man feeleth himſelfe to be tempted,
<note place="margin">Zach. 3.2. 1 Cor. 10.13.</note> that God would rebuke Satan; even that the Lord, who hath promiſed to aſſiſt his children with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grace, would rebuke him, and not ſuffer us to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted above the ſtrength that he hath given us, but make a way to eſcape, that we may be able to beare it. Sometimes to obtaine ſome ſpeciall bleſſing which we want. Sometimes to turne away ſome judgment which we feare, or is already fallen upon our ſelues and our families. Sometimes to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the fleſh to the ſpirit; and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>The other ſort is the publike Faſt,
<note place="margin">The publike faſts.</note> which is openly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and publikely practiſed. Of this the Scripture ſpeaketh evidently in this place,
<note place="margin">2 Chro. 20.3. Ezr. 8.21. Ioel 2.15, 16.</note> and oftentimes elſewhere: which is done when a whole congregation or ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations aſſemble together to performe the forenamed duties of humiliation, and to remove ſome publike calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the ſword, famine, peſtilence, inuaſion of enemies and ſuch like.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> But let us conſider the reaſons in particular. The firſt is to prevent ſome heavy and imminent danger threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21898:35"/>as a fire ready to fall upon his people and to conſume them. For this cauſe did <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> proclaime a ſolemne faſt, and joyned it with prayer, ſaying,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.12.</note> 
                     <hi>In us is no ſtrength to ſtand againſt this great multitude that commeth againſt us, neither know we what to doe, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> The ſecond cauſe is the angry face of God puniſhing,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thereby to remove the preſent calamity, as warre, famine, plague, and other like fearefull ſickneſſe or contagious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation. Thus have we preſent occaſion to humble our ſelues if ever we had. For if we muſt ſeeke the Lord before affliction come, while he ſharpneth his arrowes and whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his glittering ſword, how much more when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Angell is ſent among us, and many fall downe on every ſide? This moved <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the Elders of Iſrael, when they ſaw the wrath of God kindled againſt them, &amp; the choſen men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſmitten down,
<note place="margin">Ioſh. 7.8.</note> &amp; the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to preuaile againſt them, to cry out, <hi>O Lord, what ſhall I ſay, when Iſrael turneth their backes before their enemies?</hi> And when the people were ſmitten by the children of <hi>Benjamin</hi> with a greeuous ſlaughter, they went up and came to the houſe of the Lord, <hi>and wept and ſate there before the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iudg. 20.26.</note> 
                     <hi>and faſted that day untill the even.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third cauſe is Gods threatning to deſtroy for ſome generall or notorious ſins reigning in the land, &amp; crying unto God for vengance. This moved theſe Ninevites to faſt, when <hi>Ionah</hi> the Prophet cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt them,
<note place="margin">Chap. 1.2.</note> becauſe their <hi>wickedneſſe was come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</hi> This is ſo urgent a cauſe, that it prevailed with <hi>Ahab,</hi> who by the inſtigation of wicked <hi>Iezabel</hi> ſold himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe; for when he heard the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful threatning denounced againſt him by the Prophet &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his houſe, <hi>he rent his garments, put on ſackcloth, faſted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 21.27.</note> 
                     <hi>and humbled himſelfe,</hi> whereby he obtained a reſpit of the judgement: a temporall reward for a temporal repentance. The fourth cauſe is the calamity and miſery of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches lying under the Croſſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 80.13.</note> when the boare out
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21898:36"/>of the wood doth waſte them, and the wild beaſt of the field devoure them; to witneſſe our communion of Saints, and to ſhew a fellow feeling of their ſighes and ſorrowes, that they alſo may doe the like for us. This ſeemeth to be the cauſe of the aſſembly of the Congregation at <hi>Antioch,</hi> they laboured mightily in praier &amp; <hi>faſting for the</hi> people of God diſperſed among the Gentiles,
<note place="margin">Act. 13.2.5.</note> and ſpecially for the poore Saints at Ieruſalem perſecuted through the cruelty of <hi>Herod Act.</hi> 12. The laſt cauſe why the Churches aſſembled in this manner, was, to crave a bleſſing from God, when they did enterprize or execute any ſpecial work which highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the church or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth.
<note place="margin">Act. 13.3.</note> When the Church did <hi>lay their hands on Paul &amp; Barrabas, they faſted and prayed,</hi> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended them to the grace of God, that he would proſper their miniſtery. Theſe were the reaſons of ſuch ſolemne aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. And are not the ſame cauſes found among us? Yes doubtleſſe, all of them preſſe us to the practiſe of this duty, and call upon us for humiliation to move the Lord to ſhew mercy in theſe daies of trouble &amp; heavineſſe. Are not da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers threatned on every ſide, nay are they not already inflicted upon us? Hath not the Lord a controverſie againſt us for our common ſinnes? hath not iniquity the upper hand, and is not godlineſſe troden under foot? And as for the miſeries and deſolations of the neighbouring Churches, are they not in paine like a woman in travaile &amp; bring forth nothing but wind?
<note place="margin">Pſal. 79.1.2.3.4.</note> may we not ſay, <hi>The heathen are come into thine inheritance, thine holy Temple have they defiled, and ſhed the blood of thy Saints like water; that they are become a reproach to their enimies, a ſcorne and deriſion to them that are round about them, who ſay, where is their God?</hi> Laſtly, we enterprize great things, how can we looke for a bleſſing, if we crave it not with faſting and prayer? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this is the cauſe why we have no better ſucceſſe in our endeavours, becauſe we truſt in our multitudes, munition, pollicies, and ſeeke not aright the God of heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:21898:36"/>
                  <p>Let us come to the uſes.

But may we not ſay the like of the Sabbath? is it to be holden wholly ceremoniall, &amp; not to be obſerued as moral, becauſe the day is changed, and all the rites aboliſhed together with the ſtrict reſt? No doubtleſſe, there remaineth a Sabboth and holy day of reſt for the people of God to the end of the world, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would ſoone periſh out of the earth. So we may ſay touching faſting, true it is, we find no ſetled time in the new Teſtament appointed and ſet apart to faſt by the ordinance of Chriſt; nevertheleſſe, becauſe the cauſes of faſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, which we noted before, as great a neceſſity lyeth upon us, as ever lay upon the Iewes, when the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhall be offered unto us, that were offered unto them. Now where the cauſes of the inſtitution remaine, there the things themſelues muſt continue: but the cauſes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution remaine, therfore faſting it ſelfe muſt continue. Be ſides, when our Saviour was blamed by the Phariſees Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples &amp; the Diſciples of <hi>Iohn,</hi> becauſe his diſciples faſted not, doth he exempt them vtterly from it &amp; diſcharge them from ſuch practiſe as impertinent unto them?

                  <p>Secondly, it reproveth the Popiſh faſting,

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21898:37"/>here is one myſtery of iniquity. The chiefe points of religion remaine in the Church of Rome, howbeit in name onely, not in nature: in ſhew, not in ſubſtance: in appearance, not in truth: I may ſay therefore of them as <hi>Iohn</hi> doth to the Angel of the Church in <hi>Sardis, I know thy workes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 3.1.</note> 
                     <hi>that thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, and art dead.</hi> They have the name of Chriſt, of juſtification, of the Scripture, of prayer, of faith, of the Sacraments, of repentance: but they have ſet up a mock-Chriſt, they have overthrowne his humanity, and deſtroyed all his Offices: they beleeve juſtification, but it is by their owne workes: they receive faith, but it is nothing but a beleeving the word to be true, which alſo the Devils doe: they admit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but it is nothing elſe but penance and corporall chaſticement: they acknowledge the Scriptures, but they have patched their <hi>Apochryphal</hi> additions unto them and their owne Traditions, as unwritten verities, to be of equall authority with them: they uſe prayer, but it is in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue: they have the Sacraments, but one of them they have defiled, the other they have deſtroyed, and turned it into the idolatrous and blaſphemous <hi>Maſſe.</hi> And herein lyeth the depth of Satan. For if he ſhould utterly have aboliſhed theſe fundamentall points of religion, and not have broched lyes in hypocriſie, all men would ſoone have eſpied the treachery. The like I might ſay of <hi>faſting.</hi> What the Popiſh faſt is,
<note place="margin">What the Popiſh faſt is.</note> I will deſcribe out of their owne writers: It is an abſtinence from fleſh onely, and the things that come from it, according to the order of the Church, upon ſet and certaine times appointed to make ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, to merit the grace of Chriſt, and to obtaine everlaſting life.

                  <p>Thirdly, the converſion of a ſinner is as I may ſay,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the <hi>onely</hi> miracle of the Goſpell. It is uſuall with the Lord to ſhadow his miracles by outward meanes,

<note place="margin">It is our duty to be ſwift to heare.</note> we muſt learne to take all occaſions to heare the word, and to attend unto it in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. This is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Miniſter to take all occaſions,

Let us then ſow morning and evening; and let the people have the earely and the latter raine. Be it we have here no good ſucceſſe, we ſhall find a reward elſe where.

Will we not ceaſe or give over to plow our land, but till it in the morning and afternoone; and ſhall we not thinke the furrowes of our hearts have as much need to be ſtriken? Hath the earth need of the earely and latter raine, and are not we as barren and dry, wanting the morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhewres to make our ſoules fruitfull? It may well be, when we purſued and ſought after with greedineſſe our worldly buſineſſe or our carnall pleaſures; if we had followed the calling of God, and waited at the poſtes of his houſe, if we had beene as carefull and eager to heare, as we are fooliſh and madde to follow our vanities, we might have obtained and receiued faith and repentance long agoe. Shall we then be ſo Prophane as to bring the Lord to dance our attendance, and to give us his grace when we our ſelues liſt, and to beſtow it upon us at our leyſure and pleaſure? In all worldly buſineſſe we know we muſt take opportunity while it is offered: we can ſay that tide and time tarryeth no man, and that happily we may never have the ſame occaſion offered us againe: why then are we not as wiſe for ſpirituall and heavenly things, as we are for earthly? and for the life to come as for this preſent life? Remember this, if we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nothing elſe, that <hi>Iacob</hi> obtained the bleſſing while <hi>Eſau</hi> was in hunting, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.

Never therefore wickedly accuſe the Lord for not giving to

<note place="margin">Math. 23.32.34.35. Rom. 2.5.6.</note> making our ſelues two-fold more the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of hell, as <hi>Math.</hi> 23.32.34.35. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5.6. This delaying is no better then a dallying with God, and either repentance followeth in the end, or we never repent at all. If repentance doe ever follow and be at the laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which is the beſt we can jmagine, it will breed more matter of bitter ſorrow and anguiſh that we have beene ſo ſimple or ſo ſenſleſſe. If it follow not, what can we be but ſonnes of perdition as <hi>Iudas</hi> was? and as we have filled up the meaſure of our ſinnes, ſo we bring upon our owne heads the fulneſſe and fierceneſſe of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we may be deprived of the meanes of our Saluation for ever by procraſtination, and deferring of this waighty worke, I meane of the word, by which we heard before, that God uſually and ordinarily worketh this gift. For we ſee the word continueth not alwayes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21898:44"/>in one place or among one people, but is tranſlated from Pariſh to Pariſh, nay from Kingdome to Kingdome, from one nation to an other people, as God oftentimes threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth both Iewes and Gentiles, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.21 22.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the longer it is differred, the harder it is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the ſooner we are hardned: &amp; that for two cauſes, firſt becauſe God in iudgment withdraweth his grace by little and little, ſo that he which is not fit to day, ſhal find himſelf leſſe fit to morrow, and every day leſſe then other. And wherfore? becauſe whoſoever hath not the care to ſtir up the gift that is in him,
<note place="margin">Math. 13.12.</note> 
                     <hi>from him ſhall be taken away even that that he hath.</hi> Secondly, becauſe ſinne taketh the deeper roote, the longer the tree groweth, the root is deeper, and ſpreadeth further, ſo that it will be the more hardly tranſplanted and removed,
<note place="margin">Ier. 13.23.</note> as <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. <hi>Can the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian change his skin? or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doe good that are accuſtomed to doe evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This reproveth firſt of all the corruption of ſuch as live in the continuall ſound of the word,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe; </seg>1</label> and often heare out of it the abſolute neceſſity of this duty of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and yet prolong the practiſe thereof; who are not ſo wiſe in their generation,
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.8.</note> 
                     <hi>as the Children of this world.</hi> Such are they that will leave ſinne, when the weakneſſe of age, the infirmities of ſickneſſe, and the approching of death do hinder them from following the ſame. In this caſe we may thanke, not them, but their want of ſtrength to purſue after the ſame. For what thank is it, to renounce the world, when we are leaving it, and weary of it? then ſinne leaveth us,
<note place="margin">The dangers of procraſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> rather than we ſinne. Let us therefore conſider the dangers of Procraſtination: Firſt Satan is moſt hardly caſt out, when he hath a long time kept poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. We ſee this in the man that was poſſeſſed of a child by a dumbe ſpirit, how hardly was he removed and diſpoſſed? the Diſciples, when they ſaw him foming and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21898:44"/>gnaſhing with his teeth, could doe nothing: and when our Saviour rebuked him and charged him to come out, <hi>the ſpirit cryed and rent him ſore, and he was as one dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 9.26.</note> 
                     <hi>in ſo much that many ſayd, he is dead.</hi> When a man hath had long poſſeſſion of an houſe, and can preſcribe for many yeares, will he eaſily let goe his hold, and ſuffer himſelfe to be diſentred? ſo it is with ſinne, when it hath long dwelt in the heart, like a man in his houſe, it is hardly caſt out. Nay, we our ſelues grow unwilling to leave the pleaſures of ſinne, by continuance in the chaines and ſnares of Satan, as it was with the bond-ſervant, that ſaid plainly, <hi>I love my Maſter, I will not goe out free,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 21.5.</note> &amp; ſo ſerueth him for ever: ſo when we grow in love with ſinne and have ſerved it long as our Maſter, we regard not to be free, but deſire to be kept in bondage for ever.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly ſinne and the ſtrength of it by continuance is encreaſed, becauſe it bringeth more waight to the burden, one ſinne bringeth in a ſecond, and a ſecond a third, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany followeth. Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> old age and ſickneſſe will be muſt unfit for this buſineſſe of repentance,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.5.</note> and a burden too hard to be borne, when <hi>the Graſſehopper wil be a burden.</hi> When we are hardly able to put off or on our apparrell, how ſhall we put off ſinne, and put on righteouſneſſe? Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> we may be deprived of the meanes whereby it ſhould be wrought in us; and if the word were not effectuall to convert us, while he had it and heard it, alas what hope can we have to be turned to God without this, when we have it not? Fiftly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If the meanes be not taken from us, yet the threed of life may be cut off. For life is uncertaine;
<note place="margin">Iam. 4.14. Pſal. 90.9.6.12.</note> 
                     <hi>it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away,</hi> or <hi>we ſpend our yeares as a tale that is told; in the morning it floriſheth, and groweth up, in the evening it is cut downe:</hi> and therefore we may be called hence ſuddainly, to teach us to learne ſo to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21898:45"/>unto wiſedome.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Laſtly, we may have ſuch hardneſſe of heart, having our conſciences ſeared with an hote yron, that we may have our underſtandings darkned, and our hearts ſo blinded, that we ſhall be paſt feeling, and cannot find repentance, though we ſought it with teares, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did. This is a deepe, yet juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that they who have had deafe eares to God in their health, ſhould be made deafe by him; that they ſhall heare no word of comfort: and ſtriken dumbe by him, that they ſhall not be able to ſpeake to him, or if they open their mouthes, he will not heare them when they call upon him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> learne to further our ſelues in the ſpeedy practiſe of this duty,
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.17.</note> and obſerve the Counſell of the Angel to <hi>Lot, Eſcape for thy life, looke not behind thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtay thou in all the plaine, leaſt thou be conſumed.</hi> Let us make the preſent day,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.2.</note> the day of our repentance; <hi>now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation.</hi> He giveth no man liberty untill the morrow. The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Boast not thy ſelfe of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> We may not ſay to our poore neighbour that is like to our ſelues,
<note place="margin">Pro. 3.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Goe, and come again, and to morrow I will give:</hi> and ſhall we dare make ſuch a ſleeveleſſe anſwer to the eternall God,
<note place="margin">Reuel. 3.20. Gant. 5.2.</note> when <hi>he ſtandeth at the doore and knocketh,</hi> that we ſhould <hi>open unto him,</hi> Goe thy way, and come againe hereafter, I am not now at leiſure? And may we not ſay to ſuch loyterers, as our Saviour doth to ſuch as he ſent to labour in his vineyard, <hi>Why stand yee here all the day idle?</hi> Eſpecially conſidering that we have ſundry motives to ſtirre us up not to delay the time, ſeing <hi>we know not what ſhall be on the morrow, Iam.</hi> 4.14. Firſt, it is a juſt thing with God to contemne that man dying, that deſpiſed him living. He that calleth not upon God in his proſperity, will God heare his cry,
<note place="margin">Iob. 27.9.</note> when trouble commeth upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:21898:45"/>The beſt way to kil a Serpent is to bruiſe his head, and when it is young: ſo the ſafeſt and ſureſt way to withſtand ſinne and Satan will be in the beginning, not the latter and of our dayes; in health, not in ſickneſſe; in life, not in death; betimes, not when it is too late. See this in the fooliſh Virgins, that lingred their time of repentance: but when the ſeaſon was paſt, they cryed againe and againe, <hi>Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 25.11.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, open unto us:</hi> And what anſwer did they receive? <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily, I ſay unto you, I know you not:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 13.24.</note> verifying the ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>Many, I ſay unto you, will strive to enter in, and ſhall not be able,</hi> becauſe doubtleſſe they ſtrive when it is too late. Secondly, we muſt looke for a time when there will be judgement without mercy; now is the time of mercy without iudgment. Now are the dayes of grace, now is the time of turning and repenting; when this time is gone and paſt, there will come a day of blackneſſe and utter darkneſſe, when there is no place, nor time of turning. For as the day of death taketh us, the day fo judgment ſhal find us, as we ſee in <hi>Caine, Eſau, Iudas,</hi> the rich man in the Goſpell, and ſuch like. Thirdly, the houre of death, to which the greateſt ſort poſt over their repentance, hath many hindrances accompanying it, that the ſicke man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not freely thinke of the ſtate of his ſoule, neither call to remembrance his ſinnes that he hath committed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> beware of all lettes and impediments which as ſo many ſtumbling blockes lye in the way, and keepe us from repentance. Never was there good worke to be done, but it hath found many oppoſitions. Satan ſtandeth at our right hand ready to catch hold of us,
<note place="margin">The manifold impediments of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> when he ſeeth us ſliding from him, and reſolued to leave ſinne. As then they that were bidden and called to the feaſt, had all of them their excuſes, ſo ſuch as are ſtirred up to repentance, make not that haſt which they ought, but are wiſe to their own hurt, and become the greateſt enemies to their owne ſoules. Let us therefore ſee their reaſons, or rather pretences which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21898:46"/>they uſe to hinder their returne into the right way. Firſt they alledge that repentance is full of difficulty, a way hedged with thornes, hard and painfull. Be it ſo; the harder the worke is, the more excellent it is. But what is the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the worke in reſpect of the greatneſſe of the wages and reward? Beſides, this yoke of Chriſt is eaſie and this burden is light, becauſe the often practiſe thereof will make it ſo familiar unto us, that we ſhall take pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, becauſe we ſhall have God to put under his hand and aſſiſt us in the practiſe thereof; becauſe ſuch vertue proceedeth from the death of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſinne might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerue ſinne; and we have him after a ſort to draw in the yoke with us: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God powreth ſweet and ſecret conſolation into the hearts of ſuch as reſolve to turne to him, whereby they find that peace of Conſcience which paſſeth all underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another impediment is preſumption of Gods mercy, and a fooliſh and ungrounded perſwaſion that God will accept of them whenſoever they returne to him. True it is, we have many precious promiſes of grace and mercy, in holy Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. But theſe men do abuſe them, and build upon a weake foundation: they dreame of a God made all of mercy, and forget his juſtice, which is to ſet up an Idoll in their hearts: they dwell ſo much upon the promiſes of the Goſpell, that they caſt from them the curſes of the law. Theſe are like to the Spider that gathereth poyſon out of the ſweeteſt flowers. The goodneſſe of God is publiſhed and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ſo often for the comfort of the weake, not for the encouragement of the wicked; to raiſe up the penitent, not to hearten or harden the obſtinate: it is bread for the Children to eate, not for dogges to devoure. To conclude,
<note place="margin">Nah. 1.3.</note> let us remember that as the Lord is ſlow to anger, ſo he is great in power, and wil not ſurely cleere the wicked.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:21898:46"/>
                  <p>The third impediment is contrary to the former,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and that is deſpaire of Gods mercy. The former hoped too much, this ſort hopeth too little, and both of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe. This poſſeſſed the heart of <hi>Caine,</hi> deſpairing of Gods goodneſſe, as if it were leſſe than his ſinnes. Thus alſo <hi>Iudas</hi> periſhed, who ſaw his ſinne in the glaſſe of the Law, but could not lay hold on Gods mercy, and therefore died without hope,
<note place="margin">Sathan hath two deceitfull glaſſes.</note> and braſt aſunder through deſpaire. Thus doth Satan ſhew forth two falſe glaſſes to deceive the ſight of ſinners: before ſinne is committed, he ſheweth them his mercies greater than they are, and his juſtice leſſe than it is: but after the committing thereof, he maketh his mercies to appeare leſſer, and his juſtice greater than indeed it is. But he is a lyar from the beginning, and the father of lies, truſt him not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him not; the contrary to that which he ſpeaketh is commonly true. God hath mercy in ſtore for all that doe repent <hi>from the bottome of their hearts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.21.22.</note> and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to put all their <hi>ſinnes out of his remembrance.</hi> To deny the infiniteneſſe of his mercy is to deny him to be God. Remember the examples of old, how he hath dealt with penitent ſinners, with <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot, with <hi>Manaſſes</hi> the King, with <hi>Peter</hi> that denyed him, with <hi>Paul</hi> that perſecuted him, with ſuch as crucified the Son of God and delivered him into the hands of murtherers;
<note place="margin">Luk. 7.38.</note> with that woman which <hi>waſhed the feete of Chriſt with teares, and wiped them with the haires of her head.</hi> To conclude, let us call to minde the deſcription of the name and nature of God, <hi>The Lord the Lord, ſtrong, mercifull and gracious, ſlow to anger, and abundant in truth,
<note place="margin">Exod. 33.6.7.</note> reſerving mercy for thouſands, for giving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſinnes.</hi> The next impediment is the cares of this life,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and the deceitfulneſſe of riches, &amp; the pleaſures of this world. Theſe are dangerous ſnares and baites of Satan where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hunteth after the ſoules of men, and catcheth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21898:47"/>them as fiſhes are with an hooke, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. and as corne is choked with thornes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. For as full hands are able to hold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing, no not the pureſt gold when they are full of earth or clay before, ſo it is with our hearts, when they are foreſtalled and fore-poſſeſſed with the world, they cannot recive the leaſt meaſure of grace. Let us therefore ſet before us evermore the Counſell and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of our Saviour,
<note place="margin">Math. 6.33. 1 Tim. 4.8. &amp; 6.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and all theſe things ſhall be ministred unto you.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> An other impediment is the quiet and peaceable end of obſtinate ſinners, who hauing led a wicked and wretched life, yet in outward appearance to the eye have died peaceably, and as it is judged, very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily. From hence they encourage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in doing evill, to go on in their ſins &amp; ſo keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from repentance. Theſe are diligent obſervers for their owne endes, how the vngodly oftentimes go away like Lambes &amp; there are no bandes in their death, and on the other ſide, how ſuch as have repented have unquiet endes and much diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at their death; and ſo by them both are kept from making haſt to turne to God. But we muſt learne and conſider it well, that the quiet endes of wicked men proceed partly from the ſecret juſtice of God, partly from the cunning ſubtilty of Satan, and partly from their owne corruption: ſo to blind their eyes and harden their hearts, that they imagine as men in a dreame, that they ſtand in good ſtate, and are as well the children of God, as they that have never ſo much repented. Thus God ſendeth them ſtrong deluſions, leaſt they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and be ſaved, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6.10. Whereas all outward things fall out alike to the righteous and to the wicked, to the cleane and to the uncleane, to the good and to the ſinner, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He aroſe from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21898:47"/>covered &amp;c.)</hi> The next point to be conſidered is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this wonderfull conuerſion from the higheſt to the loweſt. The beginning was from the King himſelfe,
<note place="margin">Ier. 13.18.</note> and from him proceeded to the people. As the head giveth life to the reſt of the members, and one wheele giveth motion unto others: ſo the action and forwardneſſe of the King,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                     </label> as the head of the common wealth,
<note place="margin">Great men ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt in all godlineſſe and be examples to others of lower places.</note> ſtirred up all the people to faſting and prayer by his example. Hereby we learne that ſuperiours &amp; men of high place muſt by their practiſe give good example to others. It behoveth them whom God hath placed in authority, and lifted up their heads above their brethren, to give good example to others, and goe in and out before them in that which is good and holy. The more high, worthy, and excellent their calling is, the more zealous and forward they ſhould be in Godlineſſe, and thankfulneſſe to him that hath exalted them. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ioel</hi> beginneth firſt with <hi>the Elders</hi> or Ancients, and from them deſcendeth to all <hi>the inhabitants of the land,</hi> when he exhorteth all perſons to repentance.

Thus it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falleth out, howbeit then the waters runne as it were againſt the ſtreame. But much more doth ſinne prevaile, when the waters runne with the ſtreame, and heavy things fall downeward, when from men of higher places it rowleth upon ſuch as ſtand in lower ground. For they draw their inferiours by their countenance, they allure them by their rewardes, they diſcourage them by their threatnings, they terrifie them by their puniſhments, they embolden them by their connivence, they charge and command them by their authority.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it teacheth all ſuperiours to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and as it concerneth all in generall, ſo eſpecially them to let their light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee their good workes, and glorifie their Father which is in Heaven. For as ſhewres of raine fall ſoon and ſuddainly from the mountaines to the vallies, from the houſe top to the earth, from the higher places to the lower,

                     </gap>ds of her Miſtreſſe. We are charged all to xhort and admoniſh one another, and to be helpers to the faith one of an other; but a double charge lyeth upon the heads of all Heads and Superiours, to ſtirre them up that are under them by word and by example. As <hi>Abimelech</hi> taking an axe in his hand and cutting downe a bough, tooke it and laid it on his ſhoulders, and <hi>ſaid unto the people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iudg. 9.48. &amp; 7.17.</note> 
                     <hi>What ye have ſeene me do, make haſte and do as I have done, Iudge.</hi> 9. and as <hi>Gideon</hi> the Captaine of the Lords hoſt, dividing his men into companies, ſaid unto them, <hi>Looke on me, and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;</hi> and <hi>behold when I come to the ſide of the campe, it ſhall be that as I doe, ſo ſhall yee doe:</hi> So the forwardneſſe of great men ought to be ſuch, as they ſhould call others by their example, and ſay, looke upon me, make haſte &amp; doe as I have done, as ye have ſeene me to doe. Thus they ought to perſwade themſelues, that either by their Godlineſſe they are meanes to bring others to God, or by their evill they are meanes to drive them from him.
<note place="margin">A good medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for all Superiours.</note> O that this were throughly ingrafted in the hearts of all the rulers of this world, that upon this ground they would thus reaſon with themſelues, Is it true that I have a ſhare and portion in the actions of every one under my juriſdiction, either in his goodneſſe or wickedneſſe? then ſurely I have great neede to looke narrowly into mine owne wayes, to be a patterne and preſident of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe unto others. Thus ſhould the Miniſter, that hath charge of mens ſoules, and muſt give an account for them to the great ſheepheard of the ſheepe, reaſon with himſelfe: thus alſo ought the Maſter of the family, the father of children, and generally all ſuperiors to reaſon with themſelues and ſo make good uſe of this duty. But alas, we ſee every where the contrary practiſe! for every man almoſt looketh upon the pleaſure and caſe, the gaine and profit that may be gotten in his calling, and followeth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21898:50"/>after them with greedineſſe, never conſidering what of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence they give to God and man, neither regarding what multitudes of ſoules they draw after them to hell.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> let inferiours be provoked by the good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their ſuperiours to follow them in godlineſſe, and to be ſtirred up to walke in their wayes.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This precept hath many branches, and teacheth us ſundry points, firſt that they are doubly guilty of ſinne, who having good examples are evill followers, and having good rulers to go in and out before them to leade them the right way,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> will not walke after them in their footſteps. If they had none to guide them in the courſe of godlineſſe, they could not be excuſed; but when they have good gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and will not be informed by them, they have no cloke nor colour for their ſinne. So then this is the ſecond rule, that they muſt not thinke themſelues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and acquitted when evill Superiours walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in all looſeneſſe and licentiouſneſſe, no though they can pretend, they have been exhorted, admoniſhed, perſwaded, counſelled, or commanded; for the leaders and they that are led ſhall periſh together.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it is the duty of all as are under the authority of others to make <hi>prayers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1.2.</note> 
                     <hi>ſupplications, interceſſions and giving of thankes for all that are in authority, that under them we may leade a quiet and peaceable life in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and honeſty.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 29.7.</note> So the Prophet chargeth the Captives of the people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.7. <hi>Seeke the peace of the City, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have cauſed you to be carried away Captives, and pray unto the Lord for it, for in the peace thereof ſhall yee have peace.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is their duty that are ſeruants to make wiſe choiſe of their Maſters and Governours, where they may be ſoberly gouerned, and godlily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. But what do ſuch for the moſt part hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? and under what roofe will they reſt? Doubtleſſe in their choiſe they regard nothing, they ayme after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21898:50"/>but where they may ſerve for greateſt wages, where they may make moſt gaine, profit, and worldly commodity; where they finde moſt liberty, and where they may ſpeake as they liſt, doe as they liſt, and live as they liſt. Nay they affect and preferre above all other the houſes of prophane perſons, where themſelues may live as prophanely alſo, without feare of God, or man, and without checke and controlment, that it may be ſaid, like maſter, like ſeruant; which notwithſtanding is the common, but corrupt cuſtome of the common ſort, who have more care to provide for the body, than for the ſoule. But they have choſen the better part, who are carried with a deſire and love of godlineſſe, where they may learne the beſt things that ſhall not be taken from them, remembring that, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Godlineſſe is greate gaine, if a man be content with that he hath.</hi> True it is, there may be one <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodome,</hi> one <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> houſe, one <hi>Rahab</hi> in <hi>Iericho,</hi> one <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſhip, and one <hi>Obadiah</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court, but this is very rare, and falleth out ſeldome. For where the heads of the family be prophane, what ſhall ye ſee in the reſt of the houſehold, but Prophaneneſſe, Worldlineſſe, Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Drunkenneſſe, brawling and contention? Where they be lukewarme, it may be obſerved that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſeruants (for the moſt part) that attend upon them are Neuters, neither fiſh nor fleſh, neither hote nor cold; ſuch care not which end goe forward: where they be faithfull and zealous, zeale will oftentimes be found in the loweſt ſeruant, that looketh to the doore,
<note place="margin">Act. 12.5.14.</note> as we ſee in <hi>Rhoda,</hi> who reioyced to heare <hi>Peters</hi> voyce and was glad to carry that newes, when he was brought out of priſon, for whom prayer had beene made by the Church without ceaſing, to God.</p>

                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:21898:51"/>
                     <p n="7">7 <hi>And he cauſed it to be Proclaimed and publiſhed through Nineveh (by the decree of the King and his Nobles) ſaying, Let neither man nor beaſt, heard nor flocke, taſt any thing: let them not feede nor drinke water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8 <hi>But let man and beaſt be covered with ſackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turne every one from his evill way, and from the violence that is in their hands.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The example and precedency of the King hath beene conſidered in the former verſe. His repentance was the repentance of all the reſt, and his humiliation was the laying of the threatning to heart by all the reſt: For they followed his example, and he knew that repentance was the only meanes to appeaſe the wrath of God. Now touching the Kings edict, he conſulteth with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell or Nobles, &amp; joyntly together they publiſh a decree; the ſumme whereof is, that there ſhould be faſting and prayer,
<note place="margin">1 King. 12.6. 2 Sam. 16.23.</note> declared by the reaſon verſ. 9. <hi>Who can tell if God will turne from his fierce wrath, that we periſh not?</hi> Here are ſundry points offered, that might be handled, that the King had his Councell, without whoſe adviſe &amp; direction he would do nothing. This hath ever beene the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Princes, to have their wiſe Councell about them, in regard of the waightineſſe of their charge. Two eyes ſee more then one, and two eares heare more then one. In this reſpect <hi>Solomon</hi> teacheth, that two are better then one, and ſo have a greater fruit of their labours. Beſides, the dangers are greater, if they erre and goe aſtray, their errors are oftentimes irrevocable, and had I wiſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth too late. But becauſe this better fitteth another place, I will paſſe it ouer. And touching faſting it ſelfe, I have ſpoken of it before, and therefore I paſſe that alſo.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21898:51"/>Onely it may ſeeme ſtrange that the commandement runneth indifferently to man and beaſt, that they muſt be covered with ſackcloth and faſt, and that man and beaſt muſt cry mightily unto God. For ſome may ſay, (ſeeing theſe things may ſeeme ſtrange) what have beaſts to doe with repenting and turning to God? have they, or can they ſinne? The good Angels, the Devils, the beaſtes cannot repent.
<note place="margin">Why the bruit beaſtes are commanded to faſt.</note> The elect Angels neede it not, the Devils cannot, the beaſtes are not capable of it. This then was not commanded for the beaſts ſake, but to ſtirre up the <hi>Ninevites</hi> themſelues the more, when they ſhould heare the crying of children, the neyghing of horſes, the lowing of bullockes, the bleating of ſheep, all making lamentation, and all ſending up their cries to heaven, themſelues might be provoked to double their owne mourning who were the cauſes of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The common danger it ſelfe might ſeeme all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to provoke the people to this humiliation: but beſides this, they had the example of the King and his Councell, the force of an edict or proclamation, yea the very ſight and hearing of the beaſts put them in minde of their duty.

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we are very dull and untoward to all good things.

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is a very difficult and hard worke to attaine to any good.

Eſpecially this duty is to be performed by parents and maſters, that are bound by a nearer and ſtraiter band to their families than others are, and ſo are charged with the ſame in a double reſpect. and generally it is required of all to keepe watch and ward over others for their good.

And who is he that knoweth and conſidereth from what miſery he is delivered, and to what freedome from ſinne and Satan he is brought, that can be ſo unthankfull to God, and ſo mercileſſe and hard-hearted to his brethren, as to reſt contented in his owne happineſſe, and be altogether

                     <hi>of whom Moſes and the Prophets did write, come and ſee him.</hi> The like alſo we ſee afterward in the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when once Chriſt had touched her heart, and given her to drinke of the fountaine of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſpringing up into everlaſting life, ſhe could not reſt her ſelfe contented therewith to be partaker of ſo great a benefit alone,

If every one would perſwade himſelfe that it is his duty to perſwade others, then would the Church be enlarged, the Goſpel be more generally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the places of our aſſemblies be better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed. But we will not learne this leſſon, or at leaſt we will not practiſe it. This is a generall fault among us all, if we come to the houſe of God our ſelves, we thinke we have done enough, and many will not doe ſo much; whereas in the meane ſeaſon we neglect the reſt of our families, never conſidering that our children and our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants muſt keepe the Sabbath as well as our ſelves, not remembring that we muſt give an account to God for them; what they doe when they are in the houſe of prayer, that they doe not abuſe themſelves, the holy place of Gods worſhip, and hinder the edification of others, that they do not turne the houſe of God into a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and his ſervice into a may-game.

If a man ſhould eſcape the hands of theeves, &amp; be brought out of danger, ought he not to give warning to others that trauail that way to look to themſelues? &amp; if he do not, is he not guilty of the loſſe he ſuſtaineth?

                     <hi>and he will love thee.</hi> If God require it as a duty at the hands of every one, to exhort, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, and to rebuke; he requireth it by the rule of relation, that others ſuffer the word of exhortation and admonition:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 141.5.</note> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, and it ſhall be a kindneſſe, and let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove me, it ſhall be an excellent oyle which ſhall not breake my head.</hi> Therefore it is no matter of unkindneſſe.</p>

This kind of reproofe ſeeldome or neuer doth any good, it is ſo ſharpe and biting. So then to conclude this point, reproofe muſt not be too cold neither to hote and haſty. As Phyſicke that is miniſtred, if it be too cold, it never worketh: but if too hote, that it be ready to skald the mouth, the patient will never ſuffet it to deſcend into the ſtomacke, but both of them inſtead of doing Good, doe hurt: ſo it is in the matter

                  <p>Thirdly, they that would be meanes to bring others to repentance or to godlineſſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> muſt firſt be ſuch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, for aſmuch as otherwiſe we ſhall ſeeme to draw them in jeſt, to ſpeake one thing and to meane another, not indeed and in truth to deſire that which we make ſhew off. For what man, I pray you, will be diſſwaded from drunkenneſſe, by the perſwaſion of a drunkard? or who will regard the words of a blaſphemer, when he findeth fault with ſwearing? The perſon reprooved never regardeth or eſteemeth any ſuch reproofe, he never layeth it to his heart, but heareth it as words of courſe, and ſcoffeth at ſuch folly, as one ready to caſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proover in the teeth with the common proverbe,

                     <hi>Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, heale thy ſelfe.</hi> If we would doe any good with our reprooving, and ſeeke the amendment of ſuch as goe aſtray, we muſt <hi>firſt caſt the beame out of our owne eye,</hi>

                     <hi>and then we ſhall ſee cleerly to caſt out the mote out of our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eyes.</hi> Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.21.</note> Thou that teacheſt an other, teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? &amp;c. Such therefore as goe about to perſwade others to a love of the truth, and of the houſe of God where the truth is publiſhed, muſt give an example to others, and be a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and preſident thereof themſelves, and ſo lead them the way. Thus the Prophet fortelleth the people ſhould
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21898:56"/>do under the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Zach. 8.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Let us goe ſpeedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeeke the Lord of hostes, I will goe alſo:</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, Come friends, come neighbours, let us goe to the houſe of God, to pray, to heare his word, to ſanctifie his Sabbaths, to learne his wayes, and I will goe with you, I will beare you company. Thus alſo doth the Prophet <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 111. as appeareth in the title, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the beginning of the Pſalme, Praiſe ye the Lord, I will praiſe the Lord with my whole heart: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we ſhall be like the Statues in the high way, which point the way to others, but never remove out of their place themſelves, or like our common ringers, who helpe to bring others into the Church, and then depart them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as we muſt call upon others, ſo we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be called upon by others: eſpecially ſuch, whoſe calling is moſt familiarly to converſe together, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſervants, and ſuch like. They muſt not, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, thinke amiſſe to be often admoniſhed by their Parents, Maſters, or Superiors, or eſteeme it any diſgrant or reproch to be pricked forward by the goad of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, much leſſe ſay with the obſtinate and refractory, <hi>Let us breake their bandes,</hi>

And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though he were perſwaded of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they <hi>were full of goodneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15.14.</note>

Thus albeit they retaine the name of faſting, yet they have altered the nature of it; and albeit they make it meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet was it but a notorious mocking of God, a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of him, and a deluding of his people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we receive from hence encouragement in performance of theſe duties yea comfort, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that God will ſpare us, and ſave us, returne to us, if we returne to him, and turne away his wrath from us,
<note place="margin">Ezr. 8.23.</note> as he did from theſe <hi>Ninevites.</hi> This we ſee how the Lord performed, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8. <hi>We faſted and beſought our God for this, and he was intreated of us.</hi> Where we ſee faſting and praying ioyned together, and this benefit they found thereby, this was the ſucceſſe, they obtained a bleſſing, the Lord was intreated of them. If we practiſe theſe as we are commanded, we have his promiſe of mercy. If he be not intreated, it is becauſe we ſeeke him not aright, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are ſufficiently humbled before him, but provoke him more by our faſting, then we did before, and ſo adde ſin unto us. O how great are our provocations of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, when his ordinances ſanctified to withdraw his wrath, ſhall be meanes to draw it farther upon us! and how farre doe our evill workes kindle his indignation againſt us and encreaſe his plagues, &amp; cauſe him to double his ſtrokes upon us, when our beſt actions performed amiſſe, ſerve for no other end, but to turne us farther out of his favour, and to keepe his mercies from us! ſo that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21898:57"/>we deſerue juſtly a new plague for our faſting, if God were not gracious unto us. For what are our meetings in many places for the moſt part, but a mocke-faſt, as if we meant to deſpite God to his face, or as if we met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether according to every mans fanſie, and not warranted by publike authority, nor urged by our owne neceſſity? Some are feaſting, while others are faſting. Some keepe it indeed as they doe keepe the Sabbath, neither reſting from their labours, not attending the worſhip of God, and ſo they make conſcience of neither. Some come ſweating and blowing into the houſe of God, from their owne workes, without any preparation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or conſideration of the worke of God: where about they goe. Some are only fore-noone men; ſome againe onely after-noone way. Some beginne, when others have halfe ended: others end when ſome have halfe begunne.

<note place="margin">Prayer is a meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Gods judgments.</note> This is as it were the tongue or voyce of repentance.

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is our duty to practiſe this duty, to call upon his holy name. But it may be ſaid, what needeth prayer? God hath foreappointed what to do, and our prayer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not altar Gods purpoſe &amp; decree; which is unchangable. I anſwer, we do not pray to chage Gods decree, but to ſhew our obedience &amp; faith toward God. It pleaſeth him to try them this way, whether as his children they will depend upon him or not. Again it may be ſaid, He knoweth what we need: what need we then to put him in mind, as if he had forgotten to ſhew mercy? I anſwer, we do not pray to teach God any thing that he knoweth not, neither to bring to his reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, what he hath forgotten: yet this ought to be farre from diſcouraging of us in prayer, and from ſtopping our mouthes,
<note place="margin">Math 6.8 9.</note> that it rather openeth them wider: for aſmuch as therefore we ought to be encouraged in prayer, becauſe our <hi>heavenly father knoweth whereof we have need:</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and thus our Saviour reaſoneth, your father know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your neceſſities, after this manner therefore pray ye.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, continue in prayer, &amp; ſupplication without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and never give over, to be his remembrancers: ſuch praier evermore hath mercy joyned with it. This doth our Saviour teach,
<note place="margin">Luk. 11 8. &amp; 18.1.5. Math. 15.22.24.26.</note> I meane this perſeverance by ſundry para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the poore widow, &amp; of the vnjuſt, judge, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. of the friend that did lend three Loves, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. &amp; by the example of the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> who followed our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21898:60"/>and would not give him over, till ſhe had obtained, <hi>Math.</hi> 15. And the rather ought we to do ſo, becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times God will proove our faith, patience, obedience and conſtancy: ſometimes, to make us more earneſt in prayer, for we are to dull &amp; cold, &amp; muſt be ſtirred up: ſometimes, to teach us the value and price of the graces of his ſpirit; becauſe ſuch as are ſoone and eaſily obtained are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſpiced, or at leaſt leſſe regarded, and not ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerued: ſometimes, to make us more watchfull and heedfull, that we might not eaſily looſe them, when we have them. The Prophts themſelues complaine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, that God heareth them not, that they have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led day and night, and are weary of their crying. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? not that he will not heare; much leſſe that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heare; but that his mercy might the more appeare: for the greater our neceſſity is, the more is his power and mercy ſeene: ſometimes he delayeth us,
<note place="margin">Iudg. 7.2</note> to teach us to renounce all confidence in the fleſh, as <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7. the Lord ſaid to <hi>Gideon, The people that are with thee, are to many for me to give the Midianites into their hands; leaſt Iſrael make their vaunt againſt me and ſay, mine hand hath ſaved me:</hi> ſo would it be with us, if we had alwayes helpes at hand,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.9.10</note> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9.10. that <hi>we ſhould not truſt in our ſelues, but in God which raiſeth the</hi> dead. Laſtly ſometimes we are differred, that our danger being the greater wherein we are, his glory might be the greater in our deliverance. As the skill of the Phyfition is moſt ſeene in moſt deſperate diſeaſes, and of the Surgeon in the deepeſt woundes: for what great knowledge in his art doth he ſhew in curing the ſcratch of a pin, or a little razing of the skin? ſo the power of God is moſt of al ſeene, in delivering of us from troubles &amp; dangers, wherein we have lienand languiſhed, a long time, and from thence alſo ariſeth his glory.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is our duty to give thankes to God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> when he hath heard us, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt

There is no triall of our ſelues by prayer in our wants, for it is often forced, not free: wreſted, not voluntary: but rather by our thankeſgiving: whether we make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our duties to God, or not. Forced prayer is no prayer. As he loueth a cheerefull giver, ſo he loveth a cheerfull prayer.

For as it is in prayer, ſo it is in the worſhip of God, zeale is the ſalt that ſeaſoneth the ſame, and without it every worke hath loſt his Savour. It is ſtrange to conſider, how in worldly duties, the more earneſt a man is, the better he is accounted and accepted. He that is earneſt in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters buſineſſe, is judged a good ſeruant: he that is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in his Prince affaires, is rewarded as a good ſubject: he that is earneſt in his fathers cauſe, is eſteemed as a good child: onely in the matters of God, wherein we ſhould be moſt forward, who ſhould be maſter, and Father, and King and all unto us, I wot not how his ſervants, children, and ſubjects are reviled and reproched for their zeale. Nevertheleſſe we muſt not be offended nor diſcouraged for the taunts and evill reports of the world, but be ready to walke through good report and evill report, that we may pleaſe him who hath ſet us in his ſeruice. Onely we muſt learne how to direct our zeale aright: for there are extremes on both ſides.

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it reproveth ſuch as neglect wholly or for the moſt part this duty, as not belonging unto them, or as not neceſſary, or as if God had never required it, or ſpoken word of it, or as if his faithfull ſervants had never practiſed it: Whereas the Lord preſſeth no duty more earneſtly; the Scripture expreſſeth no duty more commonly, and the Godly have performed no duty more conſtantly. But from whence commeth this retchleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in ſo plaine a matter, and the diſregarding of ſo holy an exerciſe, ſo often commanded, and ſo profitable to our ſelves? Surely it proceedeth either from ignorance, to make the beſt of it, which yet excuſeth not; or diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or prophaneneſſe, or from contempt, or from deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, of all good things in ſuch as delight in them, or from poſting it over to the Miniſter, or from lying in ſome knowne ſinne, or from an evill cuſtome and continuance without reading or praying in their houſes. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, we muſt obſerue two rule. Firſt it is not enough to bid others pray for us, as did <hi>Pharaoh, Ieroboam, Simon Magus,</hi> and ſome others, but we muſt pray our ſelues. We muſt learne this knowledge. As Parents will
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21898:65"/>not have their children require others to requeſt them to grant ſuch things as they want, but will accuſtome them to come boldly themſelues: ſo it is with our heavenly Father. He will not have us to depend upon others to ſpeake unto him for us, but he will have us come to his throne our ſelues, with ſuch reverence and boldneſſe as behoveth children to come to their fathers. Secondly we ought not to pray in company <hi>onely,</hi> for that many times is hypocriſie.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it behoveth us to love the righteous and eſteeme well of them, becauſe ſuch God heareth, and they are much beloved of God.

                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from hence comfort and encouragement ariſeth to the Godly to pray often, and as the Lords remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers to give him no reſt, ſeeing they have promiſe of good ſucceſſe. He will not be wanting unto us, if we be not wanting to our ſelues. Let us joyne repentance unto our prayer, and he will joyne helping to his hearing: but if we ſeparate our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from our requeſtes, he may well heare us, but we may not looke for deliverance or acceptance at his hands. If then we turne unto him, we may be well aſſured he will turne unto us. Great is the force of true prayer, but it muſt be ſeaſoned and ſharpned with repentance; if both theſe go together, like a bird that flyeth with both winges, they aſcend up to heaven, and his bleſſings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the earth and fall upon our heads, as a ſhower of raine that falleth upon the ground, and maketh it f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Repentance ſtands in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from our euill wayes to God.</note> This teacheth the nature of true repentance, that it ſtandeth in turning from our evill wayes to God. For the better underſtanding of this point, we muſt obſerue, why it is called a turning, and what manner of turning repentance is. The Metaphor of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is drawne from a traveiler in the way, who miſſing the path and going aſtray, hath no remedy but he muſt come backe againe, and returne into the right way, if ever he intend to attaine the end of his journey. This unproper ſpeech is very proper to expreſſe the nature of repentance becauſe we are all traveylers toward heaven, we are all gone farre out of the way, like ſheepe going a ſtray from the fold, therefore we muſt turne backe againe, and as we were going to hell, ſo we muſt turne our feet toward heaven: and as we have turned our backes to God, ſo we muſt ſet our faces toward him. This is repentance. And touching the manner of turning, we muſt obſerue there
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21898:70"/>are foure ſortes, of ſubſtance, of quantity, of place, of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Change of ſubſtance, is when one ſubſtance is changed into an other, as <hi>Lots</hi> wife was turned <hi>into a Piller of ſalt, Gen.</hi> 19.
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.26. Exod. 4.3. Ioh. 2.9.</note> The rod into a Serpent and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent into a rodde, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.3.4. And <hi>water into wine at the feaſt in Canna of Galilee, Ioh.</hi> 2. But repentance is not ſuch a change, becauſe before and after repentance our ſubſtance is the ſame; we have the ſame bodies, and the ſame ſoules. Change of quantity is either by encreaſing or diminiſhing, as when Chriſt fed five thouſand men with five loaves and two fiſhes,
<note place="margin">Math. 14.15. and 15.32.</note> and foure thouſand with ſeven loaves and a few little fiſhes: but repentance is not ſuch a change by encreaſing from few ſinnes to moe, or from leſſer to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; neither contrary wiſe a diminiſhing from moe to few, or from greater to leſſer, but rather this is a turning from one ſinne to another: whereas true repentance is a turning from all ſinne to God in our whole life. Change of place or local mutation, when we paſſe out of one place into another, as <hi>Peter out of priſon into</hi> a place of liberty <hi>Act.</hi> 12. But repentance is not ſuch a change, becauſe a ſinner may change his ſoile, and not his ſoule: he may go from place to place, yea from Countrey to Countrey and change ayre, yet not let go one of his ſinnes: as a ſicke man doth, he may change his chaire, and his Chamber, and be carried from bed to bed, but this cannot free him from his ſickneſſe and reſtore him to his former health: ſo it is with ſinne. Change in quality, is, when things change from once condition to another, as when the leper was clenſed, or the dead raiſed. Such a change is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when new qualities or properties or put into the ſoul and body, when they are altered from unrighteouſneſſe to righteouſneſſe, from all ſinne to the living God. In this the nature of true repentance conſiſteth, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30.32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36.26. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.20. in which places repentance is expounded to be a turning

Secondly, it muſt be conſtant and continued, not flitting or ſtarting backe like a deceitfull bow, or vaniſhing like the morning dew, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4.

                  <p>This appeareth firſt becauſe the word here uſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that we are gone out of our way;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> we would travail toward heaven, and we take the right courſe that leadeth to hell: we would ſeeme deſirous of Salvation, but we go <hi>in the broad way that bringeth to deſtruction:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 7.13.</note> we make as though we would go to God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and we follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Devill, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. Secondly, we were made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the image of God in holineſſe and true righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and had fellowſhip with God: man deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his Creator, &amp; the Creator in his creature: but ſin hath turned all upſide down: man had no ſooner fallen &amp; tranſgreſſed,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.8.10.</note> but he <hi>fled from the preſence of God,</hi> as an evill ſervant from his Maſter, or a malefactor from the judge for feare of puniſhment, and was afraid of his comming into the Garden. Thus we became <hi>the children of wrath, Eph.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.3 &amp; 4.18.</note> 2.3. But when once we have grace to repent, then we begin to repaire and recover the image of God, and to be reconciled to him againe. Repentance therefore is as a miracle of the Goſpel, the quickning of a dead man, and the raiſing of him up from death to life, or as the reedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and repayring of a royall Pallace that was fairely builded, but foully battered and decayed. The image of God is as a faire Pallace, the tranſgreſſion of man is as the ruine thereof: repentance is nothing elſe but a raiſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of that image, which is to be done all the dayes of our
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21898:71"/>life. This is in a manner a miraculous worke in regard of the greatneſſe of our fall, that in regard of our ſpirituall eſtate which we recover, we may ſay as <hi>Math.</hi> 11.5.
<note place="margin">Math. 11.5.</note> The blind receive their ſight, the lame walke, the leaprs are clenſed, the deafe heare, and the dead are raiſed up to life. Happy are we if this ſpirituall miracle be wrought upon us.</p>
                  <p>Let us apply theſe things to our ſelues. Firſt,

<note place="margin">The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> that many men are greatly deceived both in the doctrine and practiſe of repentance; in the doctrine, becauſe they thinke that to be, which is not repentance: and in the practiſe: becauſe they perſwade themſelues that they have it, when indeed they want it. Some are ſo ſilly and ſotiſh, that they preſume they need it not, and that it belongeth not at all to them, no more then phyſicke to a whole or ſonnd man, or a plaiſter to him that hath neither wound nor hurt: like the young man in the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Math. 19.20.</note> 
                     <hi>All this have I done from my youth up, what lacke I yet?</hi> or like ſuch as ſuppoſe Chriſt came not to call them, but other notorious ſinners. Others ſlight and ſlubber over this matter with a little ſorrow and ſighing with <hi>Eſau, Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and if they live and have leiſure to ſay, Lord, have mercy upon us; like thoſe that in the end of the world ſhall ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us;</hi> they thinke they ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved, never remembring the words of our Saviour, <hi>Not every one that ſayth unto me, Lord,</hi>

They were horrible ſwearers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon blaſphemers, ſo they are ſtill. They were ſcoffers and ſcorners, mockers, and deriders of all good things, and all good men, ſo they are ſtill, they are no changelings. They

They were drunkards and filthy livers, ignorant and blind in matters of faith and religion, ſo they are ſtill. Are theſe humble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners? do theſe turne to God? where you ſaw them long a goe, and where you left them twenty or thirty yeares a goe, there you ſhall be ſure to finde them, never a whit changed, unleſſe happily from evill to worſe. But let ſuch marke how it hath beene with other penitents, and in them behold themſelues as in aglaſſe, I meane <hi>Paul,</hi> the woman of <hi>Samaria, Lydia,</hi> the <hi>jaylour, Zacheus,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> that crucified Chriſt the Lord of life.

So then as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 2.18.</note> ſo may I ſay, ſhew me thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by thy change? For what ſhall it profit a man to ſay he hath repentance, when he hath no friutes? can ſuch a repentance comfort him?
<note place="margin">The third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> Thirdly, it condemneth civill men that remaine in the ſtate of nature, and glory in their outward vertues, that they are alwayes the ſame, but theſe glory in their owne ſhame.

Sinne often bringeth us to the brimme or border of hell, but it cannot bring us ſo low, but Chriſt Ieſus is able to bring us backe and to raiſe us vp againe by repentance. Secondly, there in no ſinne ſo ſmall and little, though it ſeeme in our eyes as a more, but it is able to bring to hell, and therefore craveth repentance. The world of naturall men judgeth, that repentance is proper to none but to heinous and hideous ſinnes, as murther, theft, periury, treaſon, rebellion, whordome, and ſuch like, and that if they be free from the outward act of theſe, they juſtifie themſelues like the Phariſee, and thinke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance belongeth not to them: as for others, if they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21898:73"/>have any, they hope to be diſpenced with all. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo with Gods children, they have beene touched to the heart for ſuch ſinnes as the world taketh no notice off and never ſticketh at, as for the evill which appeareth in their beſt workes, that they cannot do them as they would, but infirmities creepe upon them and defile them; not onely for committing evill, but for omitting good things:
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.4.5.</note> the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is called to repentance <hi>for leaving their firſt love;</hi> they watch over their idle thoughts, and idle words;
<note place="margin">Gen 6.5.</note> remembring that <hi>every imagination of the heart is onely evill continually;</hi> and the threatning of Chriſt, that <hi>for every idle word that men ſhall ſpeake,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 12.36.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſhall give account thereof at the day of judgement: Davids</hi> heart was ſmitten for <hi>cutting off the lappe of Sauls garment privily,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.4.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. Every thing is layd to heart of Gods children, which he hath ſoftned by the touch of his holy ſpirit by giving unto them an heart of fleſh: they will be troubled for the leaſt ſinnes, accounting no ſinne little, which is committed againſt ſo great a God, which offendeth ſo holy a law, which deſerveth eternall death as the juſt wages thereof, and brought Chriſt Ieſus from the boſome of his Father to ſuffer death for them: and laſtly they are grieved &amp; touched to the quick: becauſe they encreaſe not in grace according to the good meanes and occaſions that God hath given, knowing that the more is given and committed unto them, the more is required at their hands and the ſtreighter ſhall their account be.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> let us examine our ſelues, whether we be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from evill to good, and from the power of Satan to God. This will appeare by theſe ſignes and tokens. Firſt there is a turning of the heart upward to heaven, and a faſtning of the eye upon God, that it may be ſayd of every true repentant, that his behaviour is as of one that is journying &amp; going up to the heavenly Ieruſalem the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us all:
<note place="margin">Luk. 9.53.</note> as it is ſaid of our Saviour that <hi>his face was
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21898:73"/>as though he would go to Ieruſalem:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> So <hi>our conuerſation muſt be in heaven,</hi> and our whole life a travelling thither, and a wandering in the wilderneſſe of this world, untill we be brought into the true <hi>Canaan</hi> that is aboue. But if the hearts of all were tried by this rule, it would ſhew how little repentance is in the world, when in all our thoughts, workes, and employments we are carried wholly downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which way will bring us to hell in the end: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we have prophane hearts, not ſavauring the things that are of God like prophane <hi>Eſau.</hi> Secondly, we grow every day better and better, when once we are truly turned unto God. True it is, repentance taketh not away all fayling and falling, neither freeth us from all ſliding and ſlipping of the foot, and albeit we ſtumble and fall, we walke not from God, but toward him and riſe againe. The penitent perſon is like to a man that walketh up an high hill, though he have many fals &amp; ſlips, yet ſtill he is ſaid to go up the hil, becauſe his face is toward the top of the hil: nay his falles make him more wary and heedfull; ſo it is with the faithfull, he may take a fall,
<note place="margin">The faithfull make profit by their falles.</note> &amp; with the fall defile himſelfe, yet he taketh profit by it, and becommeth more circumſpect and every fall helpeth him one ſtep toward the kingdome of heaven. Thirdly, marke how repentance changeth us, and altereth our hearts from time to time, how ſinne weakneth, decayeth, and dieth in us; on the other ſide how grace and Godlineſſe encreaſe and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in us,
<note place="margin">Philem. 10.11</note> and how we grow in love with righteouſneſſe that we may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> doth of. <hi>Oneſimus once unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, now profitable;</hi> and of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified.</hi> But if we find no ſteppes, no degrees or proceedings in good things, we may juſtly ſuſpect our ſelues, that we are not yet truly turned. This is a certaine and infallible rule, repentance and continuance in ſinne in our old wicked courſes cannot poſſibly ſtand together.</p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:21898:74"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, whether it have wrought a through change in us,
<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.23 2 Cor. 7.1.</note> that <hi>our ſpirit, and ſoule, and body be preſented blameleſſe unto the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Many content themſelves to give the halfe turne, like <hi>Agrippa, Act.</hi> 26. Theſe turne up and downe as the dore upon the hinges, ſo theſe are here and there, but it is in their ſinne, and are as farre from God as before. Or they turne from ſinne, as <hi>Lots</hi> wife did go out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> ſhe went forward for a while, but ſhee had an eye ſtill looking backe toward <hi>Sodome.</hi> Or elſe they turne as the wheele that ever is in motion, but at night it abideth where it was before: for they are ever the ſame men, their turning is without turning, they are alwayes the ſame without any change.</p>
                  <q>9 <hi>Who can tell if God will turne and repent, and turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his fierce anger, thas we periſh not.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>In theſe words we have the reaſon, wherefore they faſted, prayed, and repented. It is not a ſpeech of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for then it ſhould not be ſaid before, <hi>they beleeved;</hi> and doubtleſſe they would here have concluded, God will not returne though we returne to him; and he will not repent of the evill threatned, though we repent of our evill practiſes: and if they had fallen into utter deſperation, they would not have cryed at all unto God, much leſſe mightily, as they are commanded to do.</p>
                  <p>This verſe containeth three things, feeling, feare, and faith. Firſt a feeling or ſenſe of ſinne. Secondly, a feare of judgement. Thirdly, hope of deliverance. It is to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that albeit they doubted of the iſſue of the ſentence, as a thunder-bolt throwne out againſt them, yet not of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God toward them, neither of his receiving of them, to mercy in the next life; albeit they ſhould periſh according to the fleſh, yet their ſoules ſhould be ſaved in the day of the Lord. For if they had beene overthrowne
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21898:74"/>and deſtroyed, though it had been with fire and brimſtone from heaven as <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were; yet had it beene no argument of their eternall condemnation and dying out of Gods favour: becauſe puniſhment ſuffered cannot prove a man to be rejected, no more then it did <hi>Moſes,</hi> who never came into the land of promiſe: becauſe he had provoked God to wrath,
<note place="margin">Numb. 20.12.</note> and <hi>ſanctifie him not</hi> in the eyes of the children of Iſrael. Beſides, no man can be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally condemned, which hath truly repented; he may be chaſtiſed, but he cannot be accurſed. So then, here was faith and feare mingled together in the ſame perſons as it were wine and water in one veſſell. A true faith, but a little and weake faith which they found and felt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, like the father of the poſſeſſed, who profeſſed his faith, but withall confeſſed the weakneſſe of his faith, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. <hi>Lord, I beleeue, helpe thou mine unbeleefe.</hi>

<note place="margin">Math. 24.37.</note> as Chriſt our Saviour ſheweth, that <hi>iniquity ſhould abound in the laſt dayes,</hi> and men mind nothing elſe but their profits and pleaſures, as they did when the flood came and ſwept them all away at once: diſobedience to the word proceeding from infidelity was the cauſe of that cauſe.

The firſt ſort is of thoſe that hope, but feare not: theſe runne through thicke and thinne, and ſtand at nothing; they feare not when there is cauſe, but they preſume without cauſe. Theſe hope for his mercy, but they feare not his wrath: they have their eyes faſtned upon his mercy, but they ſhut them upon his wrath, leaſt they ſhould looke upon it; and thereby take liberty to ſinne without any remorſe of conſcience, or of repentance from dead workes. We have infinite examples both writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and unwritten of ſuch perſons, and therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> prayeth to God to keepe his ſervant <hi>from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinnes, leaſt they have dominion over him.</hi>

God which cannot lie hath promiſed grace to the humble and and contrite heart. Repentance is as a table on which we take hold after ſhipwracke, to bring us ſafe and ſound to land. <hi>Noſinne</hi> is unpardonable, if the ſinner could repent, no not the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt.

                  <p>From hence ariſe ſundry uſes.
<label type="milestone">

And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, Vnto <hi>them that are contentious and doe not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſſe ſhall be indignation and wrath,</hi>

True it is, every unrepentant ſinner can ſay, the Lord is mercifull, and Chriſt is the Saviour of the world: but to whom is he mercifull, and whom will he ſave? Not every one that can ſay, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heaven, but he that doth the will of the father which is in heaven.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To this purpoſe conſider theſe few rules. Firſt, God hath made no promiſe in all the Scripture to impenitent perſons. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye looke to have eternall life; but in the whole volume of that booke ye ſhall not find one line or letter that will miniſter comfort to the ſoule that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in evill doing. Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they deceive themſelues that looke for mercy, that lie under wrath, and ſee not their owne miſery. Indeed there is promiſe of mercy, yea ſundry promiſes in every Prophet and in the writings of the Apoſtles; but they are made to the penitent. The Lord God hath no pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhould die; but <hi>then they muſt returne from their owne waies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.21.23.</note> 
                     <hi>that they may live:</hi> he will put all their wickedneſſe out of his remembrance; but firſt <hi>they muſt turne from all their ſinnes that they have committed,</hi> and do that which is lawfull and right: he hath promiſed to draw neere unto them;
<note place="margin">Iam. 4.8.10.</note> but then <hi>they muſt draw neere unto him, yea they muſt clenſe their hands and purifie their hearts:</hi> he hath ſaid he will lift them up; but <hi>firſt they muſt humble themſelues in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> Thirdly, Chriſt Ieſus is a Saviour;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but he ſaveth none but ſuch as are his people: none are his people; but ſuch as beleeve in him, and none beleeve in him, but thoſe whoſe hearts are purified by faith. Except we be new creatures, let us never ſay, we are in Chriſt, or that he is a Saviour unto us; he hath wrought the great worke of redemption, and paid a deare price to ranſome us, his own pretious blood: but let us remember and never forget, <hi>that he gave himſelfe for us, that he might redeeme us from all
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21898:84"/>iniquity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> 
                     <hi>and purifie unto himſelfe a peculiar people, zealous of good workes, Tit.</hi> 2. Laſtly, conſider, that notwithſtanding the ſhield &amp; ſheiter of the mercy of God, to which every man runneth, he hath brought ſundry both generall and particular judgments upon the children of diſobedience, and his <hi>wrath hath beene revealed from heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe and unrighteouſneſſe of men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> who no doubt builded with the untempered morter of ſuppoſed mercy, but were ſwallowed up with his juſtice. Such were the old world, who no doubt ſet up an Idol, all made of mercy, but they found him to be a God of juſtice. Such were the Cities of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> with the reſt of the plaine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. Such were <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egyptians that purſued Iſrael to the red Sea, and infinite others. Nay ſee how God hath whipped his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<note place="margin">Pro. 11.31. 1 Pet. 4.17.18.</note> and ſcourged them with greevous chaſtiſements, as we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> and other Saints, if judgment have begun at Gods owne houſe, what ſhall the end of them be, that obey not the Goſpel of God? and if the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appeare?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence ariſeth matter of much comfort to the humble and contrite ſpirit that is <hi>weary and heavy laden</hi> with the waight and burden of his ſinnes lying heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his conſcience.

Such Chriſt Ieſus calleth unto him, &amp; embraceti them in the armes of his mere, that they ſhould not be diſmaied all the multitude or greatneſſe of their ſinnes but rather lay hold upon the multitude and greatneſſe of his mercies, which are infinite, higher then

Repentance is a ſalve that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the woundes of the ſoule. Search into the examples of all the Saints from the beginning of the word.

What changed the unnaturall luſt and exceſſe of <hi>Lot</hi> into eleanneſſe and purity? repentance. What was it that caſt <hi>Manaſſeth, Paul,</hi> and many others into a new mould; and of oppreſſors, perſecuters, blaſphemers, made them meeke and gentle as Lambes? repentance. No man was ever ſaved without repentance: for finall impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy bringeth damnation. Damnation is a neceſſary effect of divine juſtice from the juſt God; brought upon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt offenders. Such ſinners and tranſgreſſours can have no peace with God without reconcilement: there is no reconcilement without remiſſion: no remiſſion without Chriſt: no Chriſt without faith: no faith without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Woe then to ſuch as preſume of hope of pardon without paiment: theſe diſioyne faith and repentance, and ſeparate mercy and juſtice aſunder in God, to whom both are alike eſſentiall, &amp; in whom both are infinite: for albeit
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21898:85"/>his mercies exceed his juſtice in his workes toward us, yet in himſelfe they are alike. And woe unto ſuch as ſay, though we give our ſelues to the free and full practiſe of ſinne, yet God is abundantly, nay infinitely mercifull; for ſuch ſhall certainly periſh in their preſumption, and to make him all mercy is to leave him to be uniuſt in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinne to go unpuniſhed, whereas the judge of all the world ſhould do right, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.25.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is our duty, as we deſire grace and mercy, ſo to practiſe repentance betimes: All will ſeeme to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have remiſſion of their ſinnes, but all do not take the right way,
<note place="margin">Motiues to ſtirre up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> nor uſe the meanes to attaine unto it, which is by repentance. Now we have ſundry motives to move us and perſwade us to repentance, which we muſt no leſſe affect,

It would be thought a baſe compariſon to compare ſuch to a dogge, or Swine, or Serpent, but it is too good for ſuch baſe and worſe then brutiſh perſons that forſake God, and will have no communion with him. For their miſery and torments begin after this life, whereas the bruit beaſts periſh, and there is an end of them with this life. That which our Saviour ſpeaketh of impenitent <hi>Iudas,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his his daies in deſpaire, may be ſaid of every impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent perſon,
<note place="margin">Math. 26.24.</note> Woe <hi>unto that man by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed,</hi>

                     <hi>it had beene good for that man, if he had not beene borne:</hi> and in an other place, <hi>one of you is a Devil, and is condemned already,</hi> becauſe he hath not beleeved and repented.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, ſuch a one is under the power of Satan which is the greateſt and ſoreſt bondage:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, becauſe he was preſident and <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Iury,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 27.11.</note> under the Romane Emperour, and as a judge ought to have proceeded according to Law, to have kept and preſerued the Country in peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not to have uſed force and violence in ſheding of blood:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, becauſe theſe <hi>Galileans</hi> did <hi>not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to his juriſdiction,</hi> neither were theſe within his liberty, but did belong to <hi>Herod,</hi> and therefore if they had offended, they were to be ſent to him, to whom they were bound to give on account; as he dealt afterward with Chriſt whom he ſent to <hi>Herod,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 23.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.7. Laſtly, becauſe this murther was committed upon their perſons,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whiles they were in a ſacred place, which ſhould have bin as in a ſanctuary, and performing a ſacred duty in offering ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which ſhould have purchaſed unto them an immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from ſuch danger. But what theſe ſacrificers were, what there ſacrifice was, and where the place of meeting was, it is uncertaine: whether they were Proſelytes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.20.</note> or as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſacrificing elſe where <hi>in the mountaine,</hi> it appeareth not. But this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and appeareth evidently, that in the time of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing as the blood of the beaſt was ſhed and ranne downe, <hi>Pilate</hi> came upon them with his men of warre and ſhed their blood, ſo that the blood of the men and of the beaſts was <hi>mingled</hi> together.</p>
                  <p>Of this ſtrange and ſauage practiſe there were ſome that informed our Saviour, whereupon he began to make uſe thereof, and to preach to them the doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp; to apply it the to conſciences of all his hearers, as alſo to reprove and meet with a ſecret &amp; common cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21898:89"/>that reigned in them. For it ſeemeth by Chriſts Queſtion, that ſuch as were preſent and ſaw that ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judged hardly and uncharitably of thoſe men that ſo ſuffered, as being notorious and extraordinary wicked perſons, becauſe ſuch things had befallen them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he propoundeth a generall doctrine, <hi>I tell you Nay:</hi> but except your ſelues be take your ſelues to a better courſe and reſolue to lead a new life, ye ſhall in like ſort periſh as well as they.</p>
                  <p>To worke a deeper impreſſion of this in their hearts,

                     </note> he addeth and annexeth another example, not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the former of a like ſuddaine judgment, upon eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene perſons which periſhed by the fall of a tower in <hi>Siloe.</hi>

Of this read more in <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> Now certaine ſtanding under it, a piece of the Tower and wall fell downe, and cruſhed 18. of them to death. Vpon occaſion of this example alſo, he preſſeth again the former doctrine and in the ſame words, as if he ſhould ſay, Becauſe theſe 18. were ſlaine, and died in that ſuddaine fall, not once thinking of death, impute you the cauſe of this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary event and ſucceſſe, to be their extraordinary ſins? <hi>I tel you: Nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he hath thus propounded the doctrine, he farther amplifieth &amp; explaneth it by a Parable or ſimilitude: as if he ſhould ſay, I wil tel you in what caſe the Church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> in generall, &amp; you here preſent in particular are: it is as much as if a man had a large Vineyard, &amp; in it had planted a fig-tree. Now when he had ſet it in his fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ground &amp; fatteſt ſoile, he looked for the fruit of his labours: &amp; at the time of bearing, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, &amp; calleth the dreſſer of the vineyard, he ſaith, Loe, I have planted this fig
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21898:90"/>tree, I have ſpared it a good time, and yet it remaineth barren &amp; bringeth forth; no fruit what remaineth but that I cut it downe? The dreſſer, whether in regard of pitty and commiſeration, or that continuance of time might do ſome good, or hope that other or farther dreſſing might helpe to amend the matter, pleadeth with the Lord of the Vineyard for the Vineyard, I will dreſſe it, and dung it, and digge about it, and uſe all good meanes I can: and it may be the next yeare, your patience and forbearance ſhall not be repented off, and my labour ſhall not be grudged at: but if after all this toile &amp; paines-taking it yeeld no fruit, then thou maieſt cut it downe. This is the ſumme of this Parable; the application whereof is. So God hath placed you of <hi>Iudea</hi> in a fertile place, hath beſtowed many bleſſings upon you, and hath looked for good fruit from you, but behold ye bring forth none; I tell you therefore, except ye repent &amp; that ſpeedily, <hi>ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Now for our better proceeding in the orderly handling of theſe words.</p>

We may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by fiery Serpents, burned in the fire, drowned in the waters, ſwallowed up in the earth as <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram:</hi> and may looke every day for ſome plague or other to find us out and ſeaze upon us.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when we truly repent, forgiveneſſe of ſinnes and other bleſſings do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For repentance and remiſſion go together. We ſee this in the <hi>Ninevites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ionah. 3.10.</note> 
                     <hi>God ſaw their workes, that they turned from their evill wayes, and he repented of the evill he had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi>

                  <p>If then we would prevent Gods judgments,

Laſtly, others turne from ſome ſinne, but not from all: they will keepe ſome beloved ſinne ſtill; but thus <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> repented: but this muſt be the Covenant that we make with God to keepe us from all ſinne, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that <hi>he which faileth in one point is guilty of all.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 2.10.</note> All theſe blind wayes wherein the greateſt ſort doe walke muſt be avoyded of us. True it is, wicked men may walke in all theſe pathes; they may confeſſe their ſinnes and deſire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to pray for them: but this is an enforced repentance this is compulſion, not converſion; and thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented: whereas true repentance muſt be voluntary, and as a free-will offering. They may confeſſe ſome heinous and capitall ſinne, knowne to others as well as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whereby they have brought ſhame and confuſion upon themſelues, howbeit they will not confeſſe all, but thus <hi>Iudus</hi> repented, ſaying. <hi>I have ſinned,</hi>

They have often ſome remorſe and touch of conſcience, but it is a great deale more for the puniſhment threatned or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, then for the ſinne committed: if they might any way eſcape the puniſhment, the ſin would never trouble or torment them: but thus <hi>Caine</hi> repented,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.13.</note> who cryed out, <hi>My puniſhment is greater then I can beare.</hi> Beſides, what contrition or compunction of heart ſoever they may have, it is but as a flaſh of lightning, it is not conſtant; it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21898:92"/>is not conſtant; it is not joyned with an unfained deſire to forſake ſinne and to turne unto the Lord, neither with any perſwaſion of Gods goodneſſe and mercy in Chriſt Ieſus, To conclude, we may be aſſured of true repentance and of our turning to God by theſe three infallible tokens: firſt when we can ſay before the Lord,

For we ſhall never returne unto God, untill we know how far we are turned from him: neither come into the right way, till we heare how farre we are gone out of it: nor will we labour to reforme our lives, untill we know how much we are deformed: nor become wiſe in God, untill we ſee our owne folly.

<note place="margin">The firſt rule.</note> Firſt, every man that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21898:92"/>commeth of <hi>Adam,</hi> and iſſueth out of his loines (as all mankind doth) is guilty of his ſinne and diſobedience in eating of the forbidden fruit. And if we had no inherent ſinne of our owne, this imputed ſinne of his were enough to condemne us: for we, even we our ſelues in his loynes did eate of the forbidden fruit, we beleeved not God, we hearkned to Satan, we were ſeduced and deceived as well as he. In this the proverbe holdeth true,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.2.</note> which is juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in the Iewes. <hi>The fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, &amp; the childrens teeth are ſet on edge.</hi> This the Apoſtle teacheth at large <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> 
                     <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world &amp; death by ſinne.</hi> Now this ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> paſſeth to his poſterity be two meanes; by imputation and propagation. The puniſhments which all men ſuffer do plainely argue that the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed to us therefore he addeth in the next wordes, <hi>Death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> to wit, in him.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this rule is not eaſily yeelded unto, but we are ready to ſay with <hi>Nicodemus, How can theſe things be, Iohn</hi> 3. and with the Diſciples that followed him, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can here it, Iohn</hi> 6.60?

                     </label> that may ſeeme to ſtand in the &amp; way contradict the former rule. Firſt it may be alleaged, We were then unborne, and lived many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares after him, how then can his ſinne be ours, more then ours be his? How then can we be guilty in that reſpect before God? I anſwer,

                     </label> that the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was not onely perſonall, neither did he ſinne as a ſingular perſon, but as carrying all mankind in the ſtocke and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, no otherwiſe then our Saviour, ſatisfying for us on the croſſe hath not ſatisfied for us as a private perſon, but as ſuſtaining and repreſenting the whole Church in the head, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>If one died for all, all likewiſe were dead:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.15. Rom. 6.6.8.</note> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>We are dead with Chriſt, &amp; crucified with him.</hi> If then we died in Chriſt dying, and were likewiſe crucified with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21898:93"/>him, who can doubt but it may be ſaid, that we ſinned in <hi>Adam?</hi> For if the righteouſneſſe and ſatisfaction of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> be imputed to us, why ſhall not the ſin of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in like manner be imputed, eſpecially ſeeing the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed unto us, that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> might not be imputed unto us? And beſides the ſacred recordes of holy Scripture, doth not this accord with good reaſon? For inaſmuch as <hi>Adam</hi> received good things not for himſelfe alone (as we do) but for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity it is not to be marveiled at, if being ſpoyled, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoyling himſelfe of theſe good things, he loſt them for himſelfe &amp; his poſterity. If a man be capitally puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for high treaſon againſt his Prince, and forfeit his eſtate and be thereby brought to poverty, his children alſo have their blood ſtained and looſe their nobility. Even as he that is borne of Parents infected with the Leproſie, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from them like contagion: ſo it is with ſuch as are borne of <hi>Adam,</hi> out of his loynes iſſueth a naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauation and contagion. So then we muſt conſider, that we are all <hi>Adams</hi> ſeed and poſterity, he was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon father of us all, whatſoever he receiued, it was for himſelfe and his poſterity, and whatſoever gift he loſt, he loſt them for himſelfe and all his poſterity,

                     <note place="margin">Cur omnium fit culpa, pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum ſceluss Seneca in Hippoli.</note> But howſoever few among the multitude thinke or beleeve they ſhall anſwer for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne; yet we muſt know it was not his ſinne alone, but a common ſinne, his and ours as he was a common or publike perſon, and carried all mankind in him. If any aske the reaſon, why the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be imputed to his poſterity, rather then the ſinne, of other parents, as our fathers, grandfathers, or great-grand-fathers to their children: I anſwer, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence appeareth in diverſe reſpects: Firſt, by the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> we loſt originall purity, but not by the ſinnes of the other. Secondly, we ſhewed before, that <hi>Adam</hi> received gifts which he ſhould have conveyed to his poſterity: when they were loſt, it commeth to paſſe juſtly, that all his poſterity ſhould be ſtripped and deprived of them: but our grand fathers or fathers received not ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gifts, which by an hereditary right were to be derived to their children.

To conclude then, we muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinnes: they are of two ſorts, his firſt ſinnes and his after ſinnes.

                  <p>The laſt objection is out of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>

                     <hi>neither ſhall the father beare the iniquity of the ſonne.</hi> How then commeth it to paſſe, that we die for anothers ſinne? or wherefore is the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed to us? or is it credible, that that he which forgiveth us our owne ſinnes, will impute to any one an other ſinne?

                     </label> I anſwer, the meaning of the Prophet is, that none periſh or are puniſhed being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, therefore the ſonne that is innocent ſhall not beare the puniſhment of his father that is guilty,
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.5.</note> So in the law, when the Lord threatneth to viſit the iniquity of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the children,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.2.</note> he underſtandeth ſuch children as walke in their fathers ſteppes, and are partakers of the ſame ſinnes. For in this place he reproveth them that uſed this Froverbe, <hi>The fathers have eaten ſower grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge.</hi> But the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> cannot be ſaid to be innocent, as they which not onely ſinned in <hi>Adam</hi> as in the ſtocke and roote of mankinde, but alſo themſelues are borne ſtained with the ſame depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21898:94"/>and prone to the ſame ſinne. So then this place maketh nothing to the preſent matter: for the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was not perſonall, being as one that repreſented the perſon of his poſterity; whereas the Prophet ſpeaketh of the ſinnes of the fathers whoſe ſinnes are meerely perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as they that in ſinning did not ſuſtaine the perſons of their children.</p>

The end of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21898:95"/>our Baptiſme is the ſame, which is the Sacrament of our clenſing in the blood of Chriſt, by which our naturall fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe is waſhed away. Neither doth the eſtate of this univerſall contagion belong only to <hi>Turkes</hi> and infidels, to the Sauages or evill Chriſtians, but even to the off-ſpring of the Godly &amp; faithfull, even as he that was Circumciſed begate one that was uncircumciſed; &amp; as a graine of wheat well winnowed from the chaffe bringeth forth (when it groweth) wheat with chaffe againe. Therefore when any man hath children of evill diſpoſition, he muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his owne jmage in them: and when he hath good children,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.13.</note> he ought to admire the worke of God in them &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe their goodnes to be his jmage, who are <hi>not borne of blood, nor of the wil of the fleſh, nor of the wil of man, but of God, to whom all Glory and praiſe is due.</hi> The Lord Ieſus alone was free from this common contagion and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who derived not originall ſinne from his mother. True it is, that all men ſinned in <hi>Adam:</hi> &amp; it is as true that Chriſt was in <hi>Adam,</hi> as being one of his poſterity: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe that ſentence of the Apoſtle doth not concerne Chriſt, becauſe the perſon of Chriſt was not in <hi>Adam,</hi> but onely his humane nature; neither was he conceived after the common maner of other men, but by overſhadowing of the holy Ghoſt.
<note place="margin">What origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne is.</note> He therefore is excepted out of the common condition, all are borne in Originall ſinne, which is nothing elſe but the depravation of mans nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the very generation it ſelfe, and derived from <hi>Adam</hi> into all mankind. Now herein are two things, the want or privation of originall righteouſneſſe, and the inclinableneſſe or proneneſſe to evill: as ſickneſſe is not onely a privation of health, but alſo an evill affection or diſpoſition of the body ariſing from the diſtemper of the humours: ſo this hereditary blot, as a ſickneſſe, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the want of righteouſneſſe, but likewiſe a proneneſſe to unrighteouſneſſe: from whence ariſeth blindneſſe in

<note place="margin">Rom. 3.9.</note> being alike ſinners by nature; in regard whereof he ſaith they were <hi>in no ſort better</hi> then they: The <hi>Iewes</hi> had a preferment of favour to be Gods choſen or peculiar people,
<note place="margin">Deut. 4.34.</note> to have his Law and Prophets, the Ceremonies and Sacrifices, the Arke and the Covenant, but touching grace and juſtification through grace before God, by faith not by workes, it was all one to <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> becauſe all are ſinners. So then this rule teacheth, that all men are under the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, which is a matter of ſuch danger, as it were better to have the whole weight of the world upon us, then to lye under the burden and bondage of one ſinne; becauſe the wrath of God (which is the heavieſt thing under heaven) doth hang upon ſinne and ſinners for ever. We are all of us condemned men, there is not any one which is not in himſelfe damned and forlorne. Their is nothing in our whole nature but corruption; we are loathſome and abhominable in his ſight, the heires of death and deſtruction, the enemies of God, the bondſlaves of Satan held under his dominion even from our mothers wombe. This doth admoniſh us of the miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all mankinde through ſin; no creature more wretched; we have no cauſe to aduance or magnifie our ſelues.

For as a dead carkaſſe can by no meanes diſpoſe nor prepare it ſelfe to the refurrection, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay in his grave <hi>ſtinking,</hi> untill by the powerfull voyce of Chriſt he was raiſed up to life: or as a thing that is not created, cannot further it ſelfe any thing to the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſelfe: ſo man in the ſtate of nature and before his regeneration hath nothing whereby he may diſpoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or further his new birth, or ſpirituall life. This rule teacheth that many there are, who albeit they bleſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as men in a good caſe, yet are found the children of wrath, the enemies of righteouſneſſe, haters and hated of God Such are they that reſt in outward or ciuil honeſty, that boaſt and bragge that they are no adulters, no theeues, no murtherers, that they live peaceably and quietly among their neighbours, and pay every man his owne; and are not all theſe good?

It teacheth that we have no freedome left in any faculty of the ſoule to ſpirituall goodneſſe, and therefore beateth down the doctrine of the Church of Rome, that ſetteth up and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth mans free will, as if it were not loſt, but onely weakned. It teacheth that before the naturall man be waſhed and purged, every thing is uncleane unto him, yea he tainteth and defileth every thing that he toucheth: which way ſo ever he turneth himſelfe, all his actions, ſpirituall, civill, or naturall are polluted, becauſe they proceed from uncleane hearts and conſciences. His ſpirituall actions, which may ſeeme beſt of all, his hearing the word, reading the Scriptures, praying to God, receiving of the Sacraments, all being <hi>the ſacrifices of the wicked,</hi>

His civill actions and honeſt dealings in the world, his buying, ſelling, giving, lending, his labours in all the workes of his calling, are in him and to him no better then ſinnes: Laſtly, his naturall actions, as eating, drinking, ſleeping, and the like, all are vncleane unto him and in his uſe. To conclude, it teacheth us the neceſſity of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in every part, eſpecially it ſhould move us to beware, that we approach not neere the Courts of God, neither <hi>compaſſe his</hi> altar without <hi>waſhing our hands in innocency,</hi>

                  <p>The laſt Rule is,
<note place="margin">The ſixt rule.</note> that the poſting over, the denying, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing of our ſinnes is one of the greateſt hindrances of repentance. Some poſt them over, and thinke to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by appealing and appeaching of others, as <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; his wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Some deny their ſinnes, and ſo thinke to hide them, as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira, Act.</hi> 5. Some extenuate and excuſe them, as <hi>Saul</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. Thus we ſtop the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to repentance, and harden our hearts that we cannot turne unto God: Whereas we ſhould feare our ſinnes, more then his plagues. How many are there that ſtand in feare of his judgments, who never once conſider the cauſes thereof; not hate their ſinnes, though heinous and horrible, which bring them upon us? We deale commonly with our ſinnes, as the vniuſt Steward did with his Maſters debters and debt for <hi>an hundred</hi> he <hi>ſets downe fifty.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 15.6.</note> See here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in how partiall we are: when we cenſure others, we are ready for fifty to ſet downe an hundred, and of every mole-hill to make a mountaine: but when we caſt up our owne accountes, we ſay to our owne ſoules, Take thy bill and ſit downe quickly, and write fourſcore or fifty, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily foure or five, ſo unequall and unjuſt are our wayes.

<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20.</note> who never examined themſelues, they are not aſhamed to pronounce themſelues innocent. For bring them to their triall, as it were to hold up their hand at the barre, whether they ever brake the firſt Commandement,

                     <hi>Thou ſhall have no other Gods</hi> before me; they anſwer readily, God forbid I ſhould ſet up ſtrange gods. Or the ſecond, <hi>To make graven images,</hi> or the reſt, <hi>To kill, To ſteale, To beare falſe witneſſe,</hi>

Thus they ſhew, they underſtand not the Law which is <hi>ſpirituall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.14.</note> and ſearcheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is our duty to uſe all meanes to move us and bring us unto repentance. The firſt may be our preſent neceſſity.
<note place="margin">Motives to ſtirre us up to repentance.</note> If there were no other, but the diſtreſſe and calamity that lyeth upon our Churches,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it were enough to rouſe us up out of the dead ſleep of ſinne into which we are fallen. It is not our faſting and prayer that can call in Gods judgements, nay they provoke him the more againſt us, except we repent. O let us conſider the wofull mortality and the pittifull eſtate of thouſands of our brethren and ſiſters,
<note place="margin">Pſal 80.5. &amp; 79.8.9.</note> that <hi>the Lord feedeth them with the bread of teares, and giveth them teares to drinke in great meaſure,</hi> and thereby be ſtirred up our ſelues, and ſtirre up others to unfained repentance: then let us ſay with the Prophet, <hi>O remember not againſt us former iniquities, let thy tender mercies ſpeedily prevent us, for we are brought very low: helpe us, O God of our Salvation, for the glory of thy name, and deliver us, and purge away our ſinnes for thy names ſake:</hi> and he will heare us in the end, and ſend us a gracious
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21898:99"/>deliverance.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a man that liveth in this world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out amendment of life, is farre more uile, then the baſeſt creatures that creepe upon the ground. it had beene better we had never beene borne, or beene brought forth as dogs and ſwine, as wormes of the earth, nay as Serpents or a generation of Vipers. We are worſe then all theſe lying in the ſtate of impenitency: for there is an end of them when this life endeth, but our miſery ſhall never have end. Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſuch as ate not truly conuerted are in danger of all the judgments of God, which as a ſuddaine and violent flood may breake in upon them, or as a mighty hoſt of men may quickly ouerthrow them and deſtroy them. Happy are they that feare them a farre off, and can beware by other mens harmes: Let us not tarry till they come upon us,
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.30.</note> as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did, till <hi>one in every houſe was dead.</hi> God was neuer more prouoked then at this day. Hitherto he hath prevailed little or nothing with us:
<note place="margin">Math. 3.10.</note> now <hi>the axe is laid to the root of the trees, therefore every one which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewne downe and caſt into the fire.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, God hath uſed all meanes to worke in us repentance, the greater is our ſin if we uſe them not. We are faſt a ſleep, &amp; he hath ſounded his trumpets to awake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us. He hath the trumpet of his word, and commandeth his Miniſters to <hi>cry aloud and ſpare not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay. 58.1.</note> 
                     <hi>to lift up their voyces like a Trumpet, to ſhew the people their tranſgreſſions, &amp; their ſins.</hi> He hath alſo the trumpet of his judgements, to pierce into our hearts when the word findeth no place in us. He hath often ſounded the alarme and blowne the trumpet of his Word by the Miniſtery of his ſeruants that have ſpoken unto us early and late in the name of the Lord, and warned us of his wrath to come, and of our wickedneſſe preſent, and we would not heare them. He is therfore conſtrained to take in hand an other trumpet, and to ſtrike us with the peſtilence and mortality:
<note place="margin">Ames. 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall this Trumpet be blowne in the City, and the people not be afraid? Or ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll there be evill in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> For as when a trumpet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21898:99"/>giveth a ſigne or token out of a watch-tower, the people hearkneth and is troubled, and prepare themſelves this way, or that way, as the trumpet giveth the token: ſo the Lord cryeth unto us by his judgments, as it were by the voyce of a ſhrill trumpet, ought we not then to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, and be moved at the ſound thereof, and, according to the warning, prepare our ſelves to repentance? and <hi>heare his voice while it is called to day,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 95.8. Heb. 3.7. &amp; 4.7.</note> leſt our hearts be hardned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne? It were better for us a thouſand times to hearken to the ſound of the firſt trumpet, then tarry till be ſound the ſecond: to heare his word, then waite till he take up his ſword. O how much better had it beene for us, to have taken his word which he ſends among us, and to Obey it, then to cauſe and even conſtraine him to ſend his deſtroying Angel to make havocke of us! Laſtly, he that converteth not, is in danger of eternall damnation, to be ſeparated from Gods preſence, at whoſe right hand is fulneſſe of joy, and pleaſures for evermore:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.11. Dan, 12.2.</note> to have fellowſhip with the Devill and his angels, to have <hi>ſhame and everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> powred upon them, and to have horrour and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of conſcience caſt upon them, ariſing from a feeling of Gods wrath; Then ſhall the <hi>laſt trumpet</hi> blow, and waxe lowder, that the dead ſhall heare the ſound thereof,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.)</hi> We have heard before, that the ſcope of Chriſt in theſe words, to which the examples, one going before, the other following after, are referred, is to perſwade men to repentance. This we muſt lay as the foundation of our weekly meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make profeſſion before God, before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of our repentance, to renew our Couenant with God, and to ſeale to it with our hearts, and to cry unto him to remove his judgements that lye heavy upon us; Conſider

God for a time ſpare and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the Church, and do not alway ſtrike upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion (as he might do) yet it is a ſure and certaine thing concluded with him, that ſuch as continue to walke and wallow in evill without repentance, their end is confuſion, their reward and wages is to periſh. See the truth of this in the Prophet, remembred in a parable anſwearable to that which followeth <hi>of the Vineyard;</hi> he had pruned, trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and hedged about it; he had digged and dunged, &amp; done all that he could,

When the Lord had heaped his mercies upon the old world,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> and given them 120. <hi>yeares,</hi> the dayes of his patience, as the time of their repentance, he ſent the Patriarkes that called upon them, and appointed <hi>Noah a Preacher of righteouſneſſe,</hi>

This is to execute indeede a right Lordſhip over their ſoules and Salvation, and to ſtep up into the ſeate of God.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.5.</note> Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Iudge nothing before the time, untill the Lord come, who will lighten things that are hidde in darkneſſe, and will make manifest the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the hearts; and then ſhall every man have prayſe of God:</hi> and we are charged to <hi>inſtruct with meekneſſe the contrary minded,</hi>

No man therefore ought to paſſe their doome of the everlaſting eſtate of any man and to pronounce peremptorily and abſolutely that they ſhall periſh and cannot be ſaved, as if they were Lords of one anothers life and death, ſalvation and damnation, or had power to bring them to heaven or caſt them into hell. This is beyond our reach and commiſſion; and to uſurpe the office of Chriſt, to whom all judgment is committed. No man dare make himſelfe a judge, and ſit downe in the judgement ſeate to give ſentence of abſolution or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in matters of this temporall life without the Princes ſpeciall appointment: and ſhall any dare doe it in things of the life to come, to pronounce any to be forlorne reprobates and veſſels of wrath? For who knoweth what one day may bring forth, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24 1? He runneth farre that never returneth. We ſee many notorious wicked men ſuddainly and mightily called and changed, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 33. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.

Chriſtian love hopeth well of all men: and ſo long as they live, there is ſome hope.

                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it ſtandeth us upon to labour to ſee the grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne in our ſelves, and to feele the waight and burden thereof. For commonly we are blinde and ſee not at all, or elſe we are purblind and cannot ſee them in their right colours; we be hold them as motes or ſtrawes, not as beames: or if we doe ever judge them as beames,
<note place="margin">How we may perceive the neinouſneſſe and greinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne Luc. 12.48.</note> it is in others, not in our ſelves. Now that we may diſcerne of ſinne in the nature thereof, we muſt conſider theſe few particulars. Firſt conſider how God ſtriveth with us by his manifold mercies and bleſſings to draw us to a love of Godlineſſe, and hatred of wickedneſſe: now <hi>unto whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required, and to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21898:106"/>whom men have committed much, of him they will aske the more.</hi> Secondly, if we compare our ſinnes with <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſinne conſidered in the fact, doubtleſſe we have as great in our hearts, yea greater: and yet by that one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience he brought deſtruction upon himſelfe and all his poſterity, that is, the firſt and ſecond death. Thirdly, we may behold the grievouſneſſe of ſinne by proportion with the puniſhment. For what is the wages and reward of ſinne? a ſubjection to all woe and miſery in this life, to death it ſelfe in the end of this life, and to eternall death after this life in hell with the Devill and his Angels. Fourthly, they were laid upon the perſon of our Saviour Chriſt, who outwardly endured the torments on the Croſſe in his body, and inwardly apprehended the wrath of God in his ſoule, due unto us, and which we ſhould have ſuffered. This made him to ſweat <hi>water and blood,</hi>

Are ſuch ſinnes to be holden as motes? no doubtleſſe, they are great beames: are they as little moul-hills? no doubtleſſe, they be huge mountaines, able to cruſh the ſonnes of men in pieces under the heavy indignation of God.

A common errour of the world, and no marveile: For firſt being blinded with the diſeaſe of ſelfe love, few looke upon themſelves, and enter into a ſearch of their owne hearts and wayes, or conſider what they doe themſelves deſerve.

                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21.</note> The Croſſe is the calling of a Chriſtian, and the badge of Chriſtianity.

<note place="margin">Heb. 12.6.</note> veing he <hi>correcteth every ſon whom hereceiveth and loveth:</hi> and with this we ſhould comfort our ſelves, and ſtrengthen the feeble-minded, ſupport the weake, and be patient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all men. This condemneth all murmuring and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining under the Croſſe, which cauſeth the Lord often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not to remove, but rather to double his ſtrokes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. When Parents perceive their children grow ſtubborne and wayward, froward and fooliſh under the rod, doe they not rather encreaſe their puniſhment, then let them alone?
<note place="margin">Lam. 3.33.36.</note> Thus doe we conſtraine the Lord to deale with us; true it is, <hi>he doth not afflict willingly,</hi> nor grieve the children of men: to cruſh under his feete and to ſubvert a man he approveth not: but when we are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and fret againſt him, this is not the way to ſtay his hand and to call backe his judgements, but rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him againſt us, to ſtrike againe and againe,
<note place="margin">Motives to patience.</note> and to double and treble his ſtrokes upon us. Now there are ſundry motives to move us to this patience, and to ſtay us from all impatience. Firſt, God uſeth bodily afflictions to cure ſpirituall diſeaſes. Every paine preventeth the paines of hell by drawing us to Chriſt. We may learne more by adverſity, then we can doe by proſperity.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the ſorrowes and anguiſh we endure, alas what are they? if they be compared to thoſe dolours and paines, which Chriſt our ſaviour ſuffered for us? for he might ſay more truly then any other, <hi>Behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow which is done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me,</hi>

                     <hi>wherewith the Lord afflicted me, in the day of his fierce anger.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, our ſorrowes are a thouſand times leſſer then our ſinnes have deſerved. Let us enter into our owne hearts and conſciences to try and find out this point, and we ſhall eaſily diſcerne our ſinnes and offences to exceed all our paines.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, nothing commeth upon us but that which the Lord hath ſent and laid upon us: affliction ſpringeth not out of the duſt, though duſt and aſhes judge after that manner. We looke too much to ſecond cauſes to finde the cauſe of our viſitations; as alſo we truſt too much in outward meanes and remedies to remove the ſame. The Prophet ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.9.</note> 
                     <hi>I was dumbe and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> This conſideration wrought patience in him. And our Saviour teacheth us to lift up our eyes higher then the earth,
<note place="margin">Math 10.29.</note> and to reſt in his providence, <hi>Are not two ſparrowes ſolde for a farthing? and one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your father.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, God hath not given us ouer into the hands of our enemies to be chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but he correcteth us with his owne mercifull hand. When <hi>David</hi> had his wiſh to chuſe his owne chaſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either warre, famine, or peſtilence, all ſharpe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons able to wound to death, he choſe rather to be corrected by the hand of God, then by men or other meanes,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.14</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. <hi>Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21898:109"/>for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man,</hi> for the very mercies of the wicked are cruelty. For if we ſtood at the diſcretion of mercileſſe men (as ſundry our bretheren at this day in other places doe) and heard the alarme of battel ſounding in our eares, when mourning is in our ſtreets,
<note place="margin">Amos 5.16.</note> and we ſhould heare crying in all our high wayes, <hi>Alas, alas,</hi> and all places be filled with weeping and wailing: when the blood of the Saints ſhall be powred out like water that cannot be gathered up againe: when ſo many widowes and fatherleſſe children are left to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: we would confeſſe it a great mercy to fall into the hands of God and not of men: if we conſidered aright theſe things.

For how many are there, which thinke wholly and onely of heaping up riches and getting gaine, yet cannot tell who ſhall poſſeſſe them? Such a one was the rich man in the Goſpel, <hi>Lue.</hi> 12. Alas, who knoweth what one day, or one night may bring forth? good, or evill? proſperity, or adverſity? life, or death? One night or one day altereth and changeth many things, and turneth them quite upſide downe. Many men alive, merry, and pleaſant over night, and dead in the morning? in good health in the morning, and dead before night?

                     <hi>I ſay unto you, make you friends of this earthly Mammon, that when ye faile, they may receive you into everlasting habitations:</hi> he meaneth that our good workes will give a friendly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21898:114"/>to our conſciences that we are the elect of God, and have not beleeved in vaine. To conclude, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſaying of the Prophet, after that he hath brought in the counterfeit faſting of the hypocrites of his time, complaining that they had faſted &amp; God regarded it not, and pleaſing themſelves in the outward worke,
<note place="margin">Eſay. 58.</note> ſaying, <hi>Is this ſuch a faſt as I have choſen, a day for a man to afflict his ſoule, to how downe his head as a bulruſh, and to ſpread ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and aſhes under him? wilt thou call this a faſt &amp; an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table day to the Lord?</hi> He proccedeth to teacheth them and us by them what to doe, <hi>Is not this the faſt that I have choſen, to looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, to deale thy bread to the hungry, lo bring the poore to thy houſe, when thou ſeeſt the naked that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelfe from thine owne fleſh?</hi> Hereby we make our faſt acceptable to God, otherwiſe covetous and miſerable perſons may like of it, thereby to ſave ſomewhat both to pinch their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at home and to defraud their owne bellies: but if it be performed aright, then ſhall our righteouſneſſe goe before us, and the glory of the Lord ſhall be our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> glory not of the time to come, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27.1. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſcribe any power to our ſelves, let us not reſolve and appoint what we will doe: we know not what God hath decreed and determined concerning us. The Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> concludeth this,
<note place="margin">Iam. 4.13.</note> chap. 4. <hi>Goe to now ye that ſay, To day or to morrow we will goe into ſuch a city and continue there a yeare, and buy, and ſell, and get gaine; whereas ye know not what ſhal be on the morrow! for what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away: for that ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will, both we ſhall live, and doe this, or that.</hi> But on the other ſide, it ſhould haſten and further our repentance, and cauſe us to humble our ſelves under the mighty hand of God, as the <hi>Ninivites</hi> did, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their end was neere at hand, they proclaimed a faſt,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21898:114"/>they put on ſack-cloth, they cryed unto God from the greateſt of them to the leaſt of them. And who knoweth how nigh at hand our time may be! are not many gone and ſwept away, that ſeemed before as ſafe as we? The Sodomites thought themſelves as free from judgement, and as farre from their end, as we doe;
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.23.24.</note> 
                     <hi>the Sunne ſhined upon them,</hi> they promiſed to themſelves a faire day, but before night they ſuffered a perpetuall night and darkneſſe of death, they were deſtroyed <hi>with fire and brimſt one from</hi> heaven. So it was with the Egyptians, they went quietly to bed, and ſlept ſoundly, but it came to paſſe <hi>at midnight,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 12.29.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord ſmote all the firſt-borne in the land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. The like I might ſay of <hi>Belſhazzar, Dan.</hi> 5. and of <hi>Anarias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira Act.</hi> 5. Now is the time of our acceptance, of turning and changing; after death, there is no change at all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> learne to content our ſelves with every eſtate and condition, whatſoever ſhall befall us. Our life is vaine and ſuddainly gone, we have a ſhort journey to make,
<note place="margin">Cicer. de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectute.</note> and therefore the leſſe proviſion will ſerve our turne. It is great folly for a man that hath a ſhort way to goe and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle iourney to take, to carry greater proviſion with him for it. A little will ſerve to bring us to our iournies end.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.7. Heb. 13.5.</note> Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>We brought nothing into this world, and it is certaine we can carry nothing out: and having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, let us be wiſe to number our dayes, and to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out the length of our time, that we may know how fraile we are. There is a great art and skill required to doe this aright: few have learned this knowledge. Hence it is that the Prophet himſelfe turneth himſelfe to God to be inſtructed of him, as one that was not able of himſelfe to conceive it without ſuch a maſter, <hi>Lord teach me:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.4. &amp; 90.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord make me to know mine end, &amp;c.</hi> This is the beſt art of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and skill of menſuration. It is a vaine thing to be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21898:115"/>able to meaſure our land, and to number our ſheepe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cattell, and yet have no knowledge how to number our dayes.
<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of our dayes aright hath many branches.</note> A man may ſeeke the regiſter and know his age, and not number his dayes; but ſuffer whole yeares to paſſe over his head, and the greateſt part of all his life without heavenly wiſedome. This point hath many branches: firſt account the preſent time and day to be as the laſt;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and ſo live, as if every day we ſhould die, that we may prepare our ſelves for the day of our diſſolution,
<note place="margin">Luc. 12.10.</note> when we muſt go hence &amp; be no more: not as <hi>the rich man</hi> that numbred falſely, and deceived himſelfe in his accounts, <hi>Thou haſt much laid up for many yeares, take thine eaſe, eate, drinke and be merry,</hi> and therefore is worthily called a <hi>foole</hi> for his labour. There can be no worſe deceit, then when a man deceiveth himſelfe in his reckonings.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we number our daies, when we looke backe and remember the miſerie into which ſinne hath brought our nature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. Muſt not that needs be bitter, which hath brought forth ſuch bitter fruit?
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.17.18</note> the ground <hi>was curſed to bring forth thornes and thiſtles:</hi> but man bringeth forth more ſowre and unſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fruits of ungodlineſſe and unrighteouſneſſe, and hath pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down that goodly building which God had ſet up, that only a little rubbage therof remaineth. An evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit: ſo man drinketh iniquity as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and cannot bring that which is cleane from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that is uncleane.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we learne thereby to dy daily.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.31.</note> This the Apoſtle practiſed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>I proteſt by your rejoycing which I have in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, I dy daily.</hi> We muſt exerciſe and enure our ſelves in dying by little and little, ſo long as we live here upon earth, before we come tody indeed: and then I doubt not but we ſhall depart hence in peace &amp; dye well in the end. Every afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a preparation to death, and a putting of us in minde of our diſſolution. For <hi>he died daily,</hi> not onely becauſe he was often in danger of death, that there was often but a ſteppe betweene death and him, but becauſe in all his troubles and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21898:115"/>dangers he made himſelfe ready, not knowing when God might call him. He that will inable himſelfe to beare the croſſe of all croſſes, I meane death,
<note place="margin">Iob. 18.24.</note> called <hi>the King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> muſt firſt of all learne to beare ſmaller &amp; leſſer croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes patiently and meekly, as ſickneſſe of body, trouble of minde, anguivh of conſcience, loſſe of goods, greatneſſe of paines, death of friends, burdens of poverty, lacking of maintenance, croſſes in our affaires and many ſuch like, which are as the harbingers or meſſengers of death, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the way before it. Learne we therefore to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them, and make good uſe of them, that when death the end of all commeth indeed to cut off our dayes, as the ſickle reapeth downe the corne that is ripe and ready to be carried into the barne, we may looke it in the face, bid it welcome, and prepare to meete it halfe way. O how bitter and diſtaſtfull is death, to them that live in the pleaſures of ſinne, and how ſweet to the diſtreſſed!
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, labour to take away the power and ſting and ſtrength of death. It is as a Scropion that carrieth poiſon in the taile of it: and therefore we muſt deale with it, as they doe with a venimous beaſt, pull out the ſting of it, &amp; then it cannot hurt. What is that, may ſome ſay?
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.56</note> 
                     <hi>The ſting of death is ſinne,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, as <hi>the ſtrength of ſinne is the law.</hi> Or let us deale with it as the Philiſtines dealt with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> they never reſted, but laboured day and night to know, <hi>wherein his ſtrength lay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iudg. 16.5.</note> that they might weaken him and make him like to one of them. So ought we to doe. If any aske, wherin lyeth the ſtrength of death, that it beateth downe ſo many to the ground, nay throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and thruſteth them headlong downe to hell? I anſwer, it lyeth altogether in our ſinnes, and therefore we muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour earneſtly to take away the ſtrength of them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from dead workes, and faith in Chriſt Ieſus. So many ſinnes as we maintaine and cheriſh in our ſelves, ſo many ſtings of death be in us, the leaſt whereof is able to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21898:116"/>wound our ſoules to eternall death. The venime of theſe ſticketh deeply in us, it muſt be the labour of our whole life to pull it out.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, whatſoever a man would do, when he is dying and departing out of this world, let him doe the ſame every day while he is living: and what he would doe when he ſicke, let him doe it while he is in health. The moſt wicked,
<note place="margin">Exod. 8.8. 1 King. 13.4.</note> when he is dying, will pray and deſire others to pray for him. So <hi>I haraoh</hi> did in his troubles: ſo did <hi>Ieroboam</hi> that made Iſrael to ſin, when <hi>his hand was withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and dried up,</hi> that he could not pull it into him againe. Sixtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> he that would live when he is dead, muſt die while he is alive, namely, to his ſinnes. If we would die the death of the righteous, we muſt have the converſation of the righteous: otherwiſe it ſhall goe no better with us, then it went with <hi>Balaam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 23.10.</note> he <hi>would have his ſoule dy the death of the righteous,</hi> but he would not live the life of the righteous. A profitable meditation in theſe dangerous times, we know not how ſoone we may be called to give an account of our ſtewardſhip.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Laſtly, let us begin our eternall life here upon earth,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> and even now have our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in heaven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1.13.</note> and <hi>ſeeke thoſe things that are above,</hi> where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God. So the Apoſtle deſcribing the eſtate of the faithfull ſaith, <hi>God hath delivered us from the power of darkneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.1.</note> 
                     <hi>and hath tranſlated vs</hi> into the kingdome of his deare ſonne.

<note place="margin">What cruelty is ſhewed in infectious times.</note> This may be done many wayes, either by the ſword, or by famine, or by falſe accuſations, and ſuch like. But not to ſpeake of all theſe meanes, it is done in theſe infectious times, when the peſtilence walketh in darkneſſe, &amp; deſtruction waſteth at noone day, three wayes eſpecially, by ſuch as reſtraine them, by ſuch as are reſtrained, and by ſuch as are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to attend them that are reſtrained.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when ſuch as are infected goe about to infect others.

Theſe are impatient under the hand of God, and will not ſtoope downe at his correction; but as refractary beaſts lift up the heele againſt him: whereas they ſhould conſider that it is God which reſtraineth them and not man. Hence it is, that the Lepers in the law were ſhut up,

Be it that we may goe away ſcotfree; and not be accounted as murtherers in the courts of men, yet we ſhall be arriagned as guilty in the high court of heaven; and albeit the lawes of men ſhould not take hold upon us, yet the law of God will find us out, wherein we are commanded to preſerve life, and therefore much more forbidden to ſhorten the dayes of any, &amp; bring them to an untimely death. This is an heinous crime and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21898:118"/>horrible cruelty, and bringeth a blot upon our own ſoules. True it is, we may hurt their bodie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when ſuch as are appointed or hired to looke to ſuch as are infected, doe not only ſhew no mercy, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruelty; and rather regard to enrich themſelves, then recover the diſeaſed.

<note place="margin">Deut. 22.6.</note> but that he would have it known, that he alloweth cruelty &amp; wrong to be offered no not ſo much as to the ſeelieſt birds or beaſtes.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21898:119"/>and deſire of their owne gaine, either that they may doe them the more worke, or carry them the better on their backes, or live the longer to doe them ſervice, or be more ſailable to yeeld them mony, and not to obey God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that made them.
<note place="margin">The mercies of the wicked how they are cruell.</note> True it is the wickedſt man will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend mercy; but their mercy pretended is cruelty exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for firſt they are or would ſeeme to be very carefull, that their people and families ſhould have their recreation and refreſhing, their liberty from their labour, and times for their ſports and delights: yea they pretend neceſſity, and plead their cauſe that they muſt have it. What, ſay they, would you not have them take any pleaſure? what? nothing but droyling and moyling, and never be at reſt? But when ſhall this be? if at any time, I warrant you, upon the Lords day, when they may doe them no ſervice, when it ſhall doe more hurt to their ſervants ſoules, then good to their bodies; and when they cannot be ſuffered to worke for them, they care not if they play, neither what elſe they do; but whoſoever giveth, muſt learne to give of his owne: the Lords day is none of his own to give away.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in men, it had beene needleſſe to ſet downe any ſuch threatnings as theſe here contained. We know the poore have no rents nor revenues to live upon, as the richer ſort have:
<note place="margin">The poore laboures hovv defrauded.</note> their lands and inheritance is the labour of their hands: it is therefore againſt all right and reaſon, that they ſhould be deprived of the fruit of their labours. This is done many wayes, firſt when the wages of their worke is denied, or detained, or delaied, without reſpect or regard of the neceſſity of the workman. Secondly, though it be not wholly wrung and wreſted from them, yet it is often clipped or gelded, and ſo a part is kept away. For if we conſtraine a poore man to labour for us, and then will pay him but by halfes, and uſe him as the <hi>Ammonites</hi> did the meſſengers of <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 10.4.</note> 
                     <hi>who cut off their garments by the middle</hi> this alſo is open violence and oppreſſion, Thirdly when we will ſeeme to deale juſtly and truly with them, and pay them all, but it is not in mony according to Covenant, but with old ſhooes, or with ragges and reliques of our own, or with caſt garments which we have left, yet ſell them &amp; value them againe to our ſervants, as if they were new, and ſometimes at a dearer rate. Thus both we ſhew our owne cruelty, and abuſe their ſimplicity. Fourthly, when we ſee a poore man out of worke, and that he muſt needes paſſe through our handes, if we take occaſion and advantage thereby to bargaine with him as we liſt, and to give him little or nothing, becauſe we know he knoweth not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe where to have worke and whereabout to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and begin to ſay within our ſelves, This fellow is a fit pray and booty fallen into my hands, he cannot eſcape me:

But how many wicked and envious men are there among us, which murmure and grudge, that ſuch ſhould come over and dwell among us, who have left their countrie for their conſcience ſake and the Goſpels? They pretend and plead that they grow rich and wealthy; they ſee it, and grudge and grieve at the fight of it. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere unto theſe,

<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.8.</note> Is it not God? <hi>he maketh poore and maketh rich, he bringeth low and lifteth up,</hi> and doe we envy them, and repine at them? Or ſhall our eye be evill toward them, becauſe his is good? Secondly, it is Gods bleſſing upon them (no doubt) for the faiths ſake, becauſe they have preferred the Goſpel of God before their owne goods. And indeed <hi>godlineſſe is profitable to all things,</hi> and <hi>hath the promiſe of the things of this life, and of that which is to come.</hi> To this purpoſe our Saviour teacheth, <hi>Every one that hath forſaken houſes,</hi>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21898:121"/>Is it not better they ſhould be rich, then poore? better, I ſay, not for them onely, but even for others? If they were poore, they muſt be releeved: for we are debters to Iew and Gentile, even to the Turkes and infidels, ſo farre as we doe not helpe them againſt Chriſt and Chriſtianity. If they be rich, they will not be chargable to any of us, but will rather be helpfull unto others. Fourthly, What is the cauſe they grow ſo rich? becauſe they are painfull and induſtrious. And wherefore are many poore and in need among us, but becauſe they are idle and will not labour, nor uſe the meanes that theſe do? Laſtly, I am perſwaded, that God bleſſeth us and the land the better for giving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to the diſtreſſed members of the Churches ſcattered abroad: We have done ſome good to them, but much more to our ſelves, as the <hi>Shunamite</hi> that entertained the Prophet of God did him and his ſervant good, but ſhe did more to her ſelfe and her owne houſe. Thus we ſee what ſundry branches there are of cruelty, all which as we ſhould alwayes conſider, ſo moſt eſpecially in theſe dayes of our publike humiliation, when we make ſolemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our unfained repentance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> judge by this note and property of the religion of the Church of Rome. Such as have not underſtanding to judge of the doctrine, let them open their eyes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their practiſes, for by theſe fruits ye ſhal know them.

Never did the Turkesand ſavages ſhew themſelves ſo beaſtly and barbarous, as theſe counterfeit or baſtard-Chriſtian-Papiſts, who boaſt they ſerve Chriſt;

O that we would diligently enter into the meditation of this uſe, and lay it up in our hearts.

The increaſe of ſins bringeth with them an heavier waight of vengance upon our ſelves when the Lord beginneth to enter into judgment with us. He is ſlow to wrath, and proceedeth leyſurely, but when once he commeth, he ſtriketh home. We cannot be brought to feare before him, becauſe he doth not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrike: but be not deceived, he is all this while fetching his blow, the higher he lifteth his hand, the heavier it lighteth, and the ſorer he ſtriketh.

Thus it is with the Lord, when we thinke him forgetfull oftentimes, or unmindfull of juſtice and judgment: we muſt thus judge, that he is whetting his ſword, and bending his bow, &amp; drawing out his arrowes, and preparing to ſhoot, all which require ſome time: and therefore let us feare before him, and not tarry untill his judgements be upon us.</p>

                     <hi>Can two walke together, except they be agreed,</hi> that is, they cannot: but theſe anſwer otherwiſe, they can walke hand in hand together, or elſe they muſt needes confeſſe they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at an agreement with hell. We muſt learne to avoyd theſe ſinfull practiſes, &amp; know that danger alwaies commeth to the better part by the evill: ſeldome or never any good to the worſe ſort. For when the good and bad are ioyned together, the evill man is hardly made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the good, but he that is good is rather corrupted by the evill. It is an eaſie thing to defile and make uncleane; but the a matter of great difficulty to clenſe and purifie. And the reaſons are, firſt becauſe the wicked are wholly carnall, and a lumpe of fleſh, and runne one way without
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21898:136"/>any reſiſtance:
<note place="margin">Why the wicked ſooner cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then the godly can correct the wicked.</note> but the Godly are onely in part ſpirituall and regenerate; the wicked therefore being altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, are but as one man, ſo that they draw and pull the Godly with all their might and with full ſwinge of will: whereas the Godly, being partly carnall and partly ſpirituall, as conſiſting of two men, have their power and ſtrength divided, the fleſh drawing one way and the ſpirit another, and conſequently cannot have ſuch force and vertue. Againe, the ungodly are as men that runne downe a ſteep hill, or ſwimme downe a ſwift ſtreame, and therefore if they catch hold on us, or we one them, it is a thouſand to one but we are carried ſmoothly away with them: on the other ſide, the Godly are as men that climbe up an high hill, or that ſwimme up againſt the ſtreame, and therefore muſt put to all their ſtrength, and yet they creepe but ſoftly forward, becauſe the fleſh ſtriveth to carry them another way. Moreover, beſides that the ungodly are apt of themſelves to infect and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, we muſt conſider that we are by nature apt to be corrupted and to receive infection, as when fire and tow meete together,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.34.35.36.</note> Thus it was with the Iſraelites, as the Prophet teacheth. <hi>They did not deſtroy the nations, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whom the Lord commanded them: but were mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the beathen, and learned their workes, and they ſerved their Idols, which were a ſnare vnto them:</hi> Such then are juſtly condemned, that thinke they may have uſuall and familiar company with prophane perſons, a raſh, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, it is our duty to come out from among them,

                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it is the duty of all ſuch as have the overſight of others, to looke to their charge, that they foſter not, nor entertaine thoſe within their gates or juriſdiction, that are knowne wicked perſons, they will infect and poyſon the reſt.

For it is moſt certaine, that none are greater enemies to their children and poſterities, pulling their houſes downe even with their owne hands, and bringing them to utter ruine and deſolation, then ſuch ſuperiours or overſeers as are ungodly and diſobedient unto God. Let us ſeeke never ſo much to make our names great upon the earth, and to leave our iſſue rich and wealthy in the world; yet ſo long as we live in prophaneneſſe, we pull an heavy curſe not onely upon our owne heads, but upon our poſterities, and make our names to ſtinke and rot, as we ſee in <hi>Ieroboam</hi> that made Iſrael to ſinne;

                  <p>Seing it is the duty of the Church to pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that is profitable and available, hence ariſeth comfort and cheerefulneſſe in all heavy and ſorrowfull times (ſuch as the preſent times are) when afflictions lye ſore upon ſundry our bretheren and ſiſters in other places, and preſſe them downe to the ground, nay to the grave; remember the reſt of the Church of God pray for us; I ſay, Gods people, our fellow-members commend us and and our cauſes day and night with faſting and praying, &amp; weeping, whom he hath promiſed to heare, they thinke upon us in their beſt meditations, and are earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers for us to him, as if it were their owne caſe, and have a fellow-feeling of all our miſeries,

                     <hi>Prayer was made without ceaſing of the Church unto God for him</hi> and for his deliverance. Let us not therefore faint under the Croſſe when we are rebuked of him, neither deſpiſe the chaſtening of the Lord, who aymeth at our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſſe: but rather lift up the hands which hang downe, and the feeble knees, and not caſt away our confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.

But if God at any time vouchſafe to heare any of his children, it is for his ſonnes ſake, not for any worthineſſe or merits in them, but <hi>for the Lords ſake,</hi> that is, for Chriſts ſake,
<note place="margin">Dan. 9.1.7.</note> for he is the Angel of the Covenant,

For the farther reproofe of ſuch as dare pronounce the ſentence of damnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any, and judge others reprobates, and the directing of our ſelves herein, let us obſerve theſe few rules for the cleering of the point, and the keeping of us in the meane betweene two extremes.
<note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> Firſt, it is a good rule which <hi>Moſes</hi> giveth, <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God, but thoſe things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may doe all the words of this law.</hi> But the ſentence of reprobation is one of the ſecrets of God, or rather the ſecret of ſecrets, the moſt hidden ſecret of all the reſt.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21898:142"/>of others, doe plainely declare they are deſtitute of love which covereth a multitude of ſinnes. Thirdly, we muſt notwithſtanding learne the great folly of many men in the world, that build awry or amiſſe upon a good foundation. For ſeing we muſt not be as men without hope of Salvation of others, much leſſe of our ſelves, we ſee how diverſe are deceived that give an eaſie paſſage &amp; entrance to commit ſinne, till they be ſo caught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, yea ſo enwrapped and fettered with it, as a fowle in a ſnare, or as a priſoner in chaines, that they cannot eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake it off againe, neither ridde themſelves of it, as the wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſtrange woman, <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.
<note place="margin">Pro. 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>None that goe unto her returne, againe, neither take they hold of the pathes of life.</hi> True it is, this is an exceſſive and hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall ſpeech often uſed in Scripture, as <hi>Eſay,</hi> 59 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 64.7. <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.6. and ſundry examples teach the ſame, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.31.32. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.25. But the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, few come to repentance &amp; to reforme themſelves, or take a better courſe of life, that they might be ſaved. And this is another folly of the ſinner, who, being rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and threatned for ſinne, doe by and by anſwer, Tuſh, we can leave ſinne when we liſt: we will repent at ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and helpe all. But <hi>Salomon</hi> will teach theſe fooles, that few or none compaſſed with the continuall practiſe of ſinne amend their wayes,
<note place="margin">Pro. 6.22.27</note> but goe <hi>as the Oxe to the ſlaughter, or as a foole to the correction of the ſtockes,</hi> becauſe they have ſet themſelves <hi>in the way to hell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 13.23.</note> going downe to the <hi>Chambers of death.</hi> For cuſtome is as ſtrong as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or rather much ſtronger; It is as the <hi>Ethiopians skin</hi> and the <hi>Leopards ſpotts,</hi> which cannot be <hi>changed.</hi> It is hard for a man to forget his naturall language and his mother tongue, but it is harder for the ſinner to forſake his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſe. For a man by nature or birth is indifferent to any language, and inclined to no one more then to another, becauſe he hath it by hearing and imitation of others, as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21898:143"/>appeareth in ſuch as are borne deafe: but we doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucke in ſinne with the mothers milke, but as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet confeſſeth,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> 
                     <hi>We were ſhapen in iniquitie, and in ſinne did our mothers conceive us:</hi> which is a great deale more then can be ſpoken of the language which we learne in our youth. Beſides, it is a great pollicy of Satan to cover his purpoſe at the firſt, as the fiſher doth the hooke, to deceive us the ſooner; he beginneth with leſſer ſinnes, until he have wrapped us in the greater, and our conſciences be hardned, and as it were ſeared with an hote iron. Fourthly,
<note place="margin">A tvvo fold favour of God to the ſinner.</note> this ſheweth the wonderfull love and favour of God which he vouchſafeth to any, both when he preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſinne that we doe not fall into it, and when he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth off the courſe of it when we are overtaken with it; This is a twofold grace. We are by nature prone to ſin, and ready to yeeld to every tentation, as we ſee in <hi>Peter</hi> that denied his Maſter at the word of a ſeely damſell: when therefore the Lord putteth his hand under us and ſtayeth us up, that we doe not ſtumble and fall, is not this a wonderfull grace to keepe us from ſinning againſt him, and wounding our owne ſoules? As this is a great bleſſing, ſo the other is yet greater, to pull us out of the ſnare, when we have one foot in hell; as it is a greater worke to ſtay a man that is running downe a ſteepe hill, then to perſwade him not to runne at all. The truth of both theſe, we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, for when he was purpoſed to ſhed blood,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.22.33.</note> and <hi>to deſtroy all that pertained to Nabal by the morning light:</hi> he bleſſed God that had <hi>kept him from comming to ſhed blood, and from avenging himſelfe with his owne hand.</hi> Loe here the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace of God to ſtay him, that was running and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king haſte to commit ſinne. Againe, when he had given himſelfe over to commit one ſinne after another,
<note place="margin">Luc. 11.22.</note> as it were to adde drunkenneſſe unto thirſt, the ſtrong man bagan to poſſeſſe the houſe, but a ſtronger then he came,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21898:143"/>and overcame him, and tooke from him all his armour wherein he truſted, and ſo recovered him out of the ſnare of the Devil, which he laid to entrap him. He had, as much as lay in him, caſt himſelfe into the mouth of the roaring Lyon that gapeth after his prey: it was therefore the ſpeciall mercy of God to reclaime and recover him out of the ſnare of the devill, who after a ſort was taken captive by him at his will. Laſtly, we muſt labour that ſinne may not raigne in our mortall bodies. For albeit we cannot be without ſinne, becauſe we carry about the fleſh, yet we muſt take heed it exerciſe not a kingdome in us: it hath an eaſie entrance, an eaſie continuance, but it is hard to get out and to ridde our ſelves from the tyranny there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as we may ſee in <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 26. in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14 <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. and in <hi>Iudas,</hi> who paſſed from one degree to another, till at laſt they filled up the meaſure of their ſinne. It is an eaſie matter to pull up the bankes and throw downe the walles, whereby as by fenſes or bulwarkes the ſea is kept out from overflowing the land, and ſo to let in the water: but it is not ſo eaſie to let it out againe: ſo it is with ſinne, it is no hard thing to make ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience, and to pull up the bankes of the feare of God whereby ſinne is kept out: but we ſhall find it one of the hardeſt things in the world to caſt it out of the heart, when it hath gotten firme poſſeſſion: and therefore it muſt be our labour and wiſedome to prevent ſinne in the beginning, leſt by continuance it take roote and be as a diſeaſe that is incurable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it ſerveth as an inſtruction to the Miniſters of God, that we ceaſe not with the Dreſſer in this place to digge about them that remaine unfruitfull, and dung them, that is, to labour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.15.</note> yet are we <hi>the ſweet ſavour of God, as well in them that periſh, as in them that are ſaved:</hi> and God no leſſe accounteth of our labours, if we have beene faithfull and conſcionable, then if we had converted many thouſand ſoules.

It is not enough to make us ſound Chriſtians to come to Church, to be at prayers, to heare the word, and receive the Sacraments, when we yeeld no fruit of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as if it were ſufficient, that the fig-tree were planted in the Vineyard, albeit it bare nothing but leaves:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.3.</note> but we muſt be as trees of righteouſneſſe, <hi>planted by the rivers ſide which bring forth fruite in their ſeaſon:</hi> True it is, the Church hath alwayes had ſuch painted Sepulchers, or gilded tombes outwardly, as the Iewes that had the Temple of the Lord alwayes in their mouthes, who yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained wicked and prophane perſons in their lives. The ſound Chriſtian is not diſcerned by the leaves of outward appearance, but by the precious fruits of the ſpirit: not by his profeſſion, but by his practiſe: and they are the true Iſraelites which are ſo within, whoſe praiſe is of God and not of men. The fig-tree had leaves good flore which

For may not Chriſt Ieſus, trow you, finde ſtore of ſuch fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe fig-trees in this Vineyard of his? nay, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to looke upon his Vineyard, will it not be a rare thing and an hard matter to ſee a fig-tree with any fruit upon it? Nay, are we not for the moſt part come to this paſſe, that we have ſcarce any leave at all to be ſeene, that a man may take a Candle and ſearch for leaves, and yet find none upon them? This is the ſtate and condition of ſundry among us: how neere are ſuch to the curſe, and to be burned up, which have neither fruit nor leaves, neither ſubſtance nor ſhew, neither body nor ſhadow, neither truth nor appearance: but openly and evidently make plaine Demonſtration of wild and wicked fruit,

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this checketh and controlleth the ſlanderous mouthes and pennes of the Romiſh Church opened wide and enlarged againſt our doctrine, which they knew not or will not know: who beare the world and their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Diſciples, the multitude in hand, that our religion deſtroyeth good works,
<note place="margin">Math. 5.16.</note> whereas we call upon the people to bring forth the fruits of the Goſpel, and to <hi>let our light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee our good workes and glorifie our father which is heaven.</hi> Nay we teach a neceſſity of good workes, as well as they, to be in all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, that they <hi>which have beleeved in God, might be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to maintaine good workes, theſe things are good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto men.</hi> Wherein then lyeth the difference between us! they teach them to be the cauſes of our juſtification;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21898:148"/>we that they be lively fruits and effects of faith: they doe not goe before him that is to be juſtified, but they follow him that is already juſtified: they are not neceſſary in the act or office of juſtification, but they are neceſſarily required to be in every juſtified perſon.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> let us all be provoked to the diligent practiſe of good workes. No man muſt thinke himſelfe exempted or priviledged from good workes, albeit he be never ſo poore or ſimple. The moſt ſort poſt over this duty from one to another, and thinke when we call for good workes it is a doctrine that toucheth onely rich men and ſuch as have the wealth of this world at will, and none other: as if there were no good workes of charity, that did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the name of good workes; which neuertheleſſe are neither the onely good workes, nor the chiefeſt good workes. For we looke upon our ſelves in the glaſſe of the law, and try our ſelves thereby. Theſe workes are of two ſorts; ſome generall, and others ſpeciall. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall are ſuch as concerne all, among which the workes of the firſt Table, being <hi>the firſt and great Commandements,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 22.38.</note> muſt have the firſt place, to love God above our ſelves, to feare him, to beleeve in him, to truſt in him, to pray unto him, to ſerve and worſhip him, to reverence his name, and to ſanctifie his Sabbath: and the workes of the ſecond Table are like;
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.23.</note> for <hi>the fruits of the ſpirit are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſſe, faith, meekeneſſe temperance, and ſuch like.</hi> Theſe belong to all, and muſt be practiſed of all perſons, high and low, rich and poore, none may excuſe themſelves. The ſpeciall workes are ſuch as belong to every man in his particular calling. For as we have all a generall calling as we are Chriſtians, ſo we are ſet in ſeverall callings, ſuch as are ſuperiors and inferiors, as the Magiſtrate and ſubject, the husband and wife, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſonne, maſter and ſervant: we muſt labour to be found faithfull in theſe, how low ſo ever our place be, if
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21898:149"/>we be found carefull and conſcionable, even the meaneſt ſervant that drudgeth in the Kitchin, if his calling be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to ſcoure ſpittes,
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.6.7.</note> or to wipe ſhooes, yet if he be obedient to his Maſter as unto Chriſt, not with eye-ſervice, as men pleaſers, but as the ſervant of Chriſt, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God from the heart, with good will doing ſervice as to the Lord and not to men: he is no leſſe accepted of God in his place, then he that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the word, or he that ruleth a kingdome.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, it behoveth us in time to take heed <hi>how we heare;</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> not onely <hi>what we heare</hi> touching the matter, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24.

Luk. 8.18.</note> but alſo how we heare, touching the manner, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.18. and regard how it be performed, as well as that it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The more the word of God ſoundeth in our eares and we reſpect it but as a ſound, the more our hearts are hardned, like the anvill that is beaten and hardned by the continuall ſtrokes of the hammer. Gods word is in regard of the effectes reſembled &amp; compared to fire &amp; to an ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. <hi>Is not my word like as a fire, ſaith the Lord,</hi>

                     <hi>and like an hammer that breaketh the rooke in pieces?</hi> There is more hope of men that never heard the word, and never lived under the ordinary miniſtry and preaching of it,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21898:155"/>then of ſuch as have had their eares beaten with it, &amp; yet it cannot enter into their hearts, as our Saviour ſpeaketh to the chiefe Prieſts and Elders of the people,

A ſoft heart is a ſingular bleſſing: they are thrice happy that have attained unto it: on the other ſide, the ſinner that is as braſſe and iron, and paſt feeling, lyeth under an heavy curſe.
<note place="margin">Pro. 20.12.</note> Hence it is, that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth, <hi>The hearing eare, and the ſeeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</hi> We cannot ſee what is before us, untill God direct us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.16.31.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſaying of the Apoſtle is remarkable and never to be forgotten,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8. &amp; 6.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Godlineſſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto all things, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come:</hi> and afterward in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Godlines with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment is great gaine.</hi> For what can it profit a man, if hee ſhould gaine the whole world, and then loſe his owne ſoule? Now the drift of this enſuing Treatiſe (as appeareth by the Title) is to ſhew to a godly Chriſtian, received already into the love and favour of God in this life, &amp; looking for happines in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after this life, by what holy meanes he may ſupport his heart, as poſts doe the houſe, with ſufficient contentment againſt all the miſeries that doe or may aſſault him in time of neceſſity. The croſſes and tentations, wherewith the life, eſpecially of a poore Chriſtian is diſtreſſed, are manifold, and Satan worketh upon their ſeverall wants, to ſurprize them, and make them often cry out, <hi>What ſhall we eate?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 6.31.</note> 
                     <hi>or what ſhall we drinke? or wherewithall ſhall we be clothed?</hi> Every calling in the world, from the higheſt to the loweſt, is aſſaulted with his proper and peculiar tentations, and there are certaine unlawfull and ungodly courſes practiſed by wicked man, which we may not unfitly call The ſpeciall ſinnes of ſuch a calling. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle among
<pb facs="tcp:21898:159"/>other precepts beateth upon this,
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.5, 6. Gen. 28.15. Deut. 31.6, 8. Ioſh. 1.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſſe, and bee content with ſuch things as ye have; for hee hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee: ſo that we may boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper, I will not feare what man ſhall doe unto me:</hi> and our Saviour, to comfort us againſt feare of famine, ſendeth us ſometimes to God, ſometimes to our ſelves, ſometimes to the Heaven, ſometimes to the earth, and ſometimes to the Gentiles, that by all theſe wee might have ſtrong conſolation and reſt in him, that hath given us both our lives and our bodies. Conſider a little the Hiſtory of the Creation, as it is deſcribed in the Booke of Geneſis: God made all the Creatures to ſerve for mans uſe, before he made man himſelfe, wherein wee may behold a perpetuall patterne of his providence, that he never bringeth any into the world, but that firſt hee ordaineth things needfull for them, for the time alotted them to be there; even as milke in the Mothers breſts for the child to ſucke, before ever the child be borne to ſucke the ſame. A very gaod patterne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to have before on eyes, againſt that diſtruſt and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity which commonly hangeth on, and haunteth the nature of man in thoſe matters. Let us alſo take heed of ſetting our heart upon the world, and the things in the world, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy evermore to confeſſe in word, and ſhew it by our, practice that we account our ſelves to be but as <hi>Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi> in this world:
<note place="margin">Heb 11.13. Pſal. 62.10.</note> 
                     <hi>if riches increaſe,</hi> we muſt looke to it, that we <hi>ſet not our hearts upon them:</hi> and we muſt uſe the world, as if we uſed it not, becauſe the faſhion thereof paſſeth away. And if we doe not ſet our hearts and affections upon our riches,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſundry good fruits will follow thereupon. Firſt, it bringeth comfort and contentment with our eſtate, as being that portion which God allotteth unto us, &amp; maketh us not to repine againſt his providence, becauſe we have not a larger allowance; for he that doth not too much affect their preſence, will not too much bewaile their abſence, neither be diſcontent becauſe he hath not abundance of that which hee doth not
<pb facs="tcp:21898:159"/>much regard; but as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Having food and raiment, will therewith reſt contented.</hi> Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> having ſtore of this worlds good, if wee doe not ſet our hearts upon them, then we will be content to leave them, whenſoever God the ſupreme and ſoveraigne Owner calleth againe for them, and not exceſſively mourne for them when they leave us. And as we will not refuſe and reject them when we have them, ſeeing they are the gifts of God, ſo when they betake them to their wings and flee away, we will looke after them with a quiet minde, as it was with <hi>Iob;</hi> who, becauſe hee rejoyced not when <hi>his ſubſtance was great,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 31.25. &amp; 1 21.</note> 
                     <hi>and when his hand had gotten much,</hi> therefore he did not much grieve when his wealth was taken away, but in his greateſt loſſe praiſeth the Lord. So alſo it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> who, becauſe he uſed this world as not abuſing it, and eſteemed the beſt things thereof no better then dung in compariſon of Chriſt and his benefits,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.31. Phil. 3.7, 8. &amp; 4.11, 12, 13.</note> it was no great paine to him to take forth a farther leſſon, <hi>in what ſtate ſoever he was, therewithall to be content:</hi> he could be abaſed and abound, every where in all things he was inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hungry, to abound, and to have want: yea, hee could ſay, I can doe all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me. Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> if worldly riches be wanting, we will not ſeeke them by evil meanes, nor glory in them when we have them to make us high minded, or to put our truſt and confidence in them. Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it will make us keepe a vigilant eye over them, that through our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe they doc not degenerate from their owne nature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Satans baits to allure us, nor his ſnares to intangle us, nor his thornes to choke us, that the ſeed of the Word cannot proſper, neither the graces of God grow in us. Hence it is that I goe about to perſwade to lay hold on Gods ſpeciall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence watching over his children, to ſuccour and relieve them out of hopeleſſe and remedileſſe troubles, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare deſtitute of all ſuccour, and in a manner in a deſperate eſtate, without all meanes left unto them. When the Sonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> ſtood gazing one upon another, that is,
<note place="margin">Gen. 42.1.</note> they fared
<pb facs="tcp:21898:160"/>as men amazed, and at their wits end, that they know not what to doe for themſelves, their wives, and their children; then the Lord by his good hand opened a way for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, that there was plenty of Corne in Egypt, when there was none in the Land of Canaan, verifying his gracious promiſe, <hi>Gen. 8.22.</hi> So when the poore widdow in time of a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine was brought to that extremity,
<note place="margin">1. King. 17.12, 13.</note> that ſhee had but <hi>an handfull of meale in a barrell, and a little oyle in a cruſe,</hi> and was now going purpoſely to gather a few ſtickes to dreſſe it for her ſelfe and her ſonne, that they might eate and die; when ſhe was in this great perplexity, neceſſity, and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the Lord (that never leaveth his) by his good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directed the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> (who immediately before had himſelfe beene fed by Ravens <hi>that brought him bread and fleſh in the morning,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">verſe 6.</note> 
                     <hi>and bread and fleſh in the evening)</hi> to tell her good newes, that the barrell of meale ſhould not waſte,
<note place="margin">verſe 14.</note> neither the cruſe of oyle faile, <hi>until the Day that the Lord ſendeth raine upon</hi> the earth. Thus it was with the widdow of one of the ſonnes of the Prophets, ſhe was left ſo farre in debt, that her children were to be ſold to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the griping and greedineſſe of the mercileſſe Creditor: and ſhe had nothing to diſcharge it,
<note place="margin">2 Kings 4.2.</note> but <hi>a little pitcher of oyle:</hi> yet ſhe was provided for by wonderfull meanes: all which examples, as a cloud of witneſſes, doe verifie the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pſalmiſt,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 33.18, 19. and 37.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that feare him, upon them that hope in his mercy, to deliver their ſoule from death, and to keepe them alive in famine:</hi> and Pſal. <hi>37. I have beene young, and now am old, yet have I not ſeene the righteous forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor his ſeed begging bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if there were no other reaſons or conſiderations, then ſuch as are handled in this Scripture, to be as a preſervative or counterpoiſon againſt diffidence and diſtruſt, touching earthly things, which doe more diſquiet &amp; diſturbe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the naturall man, but even the Regenerate themſelves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, then any thing in the world beſides, herein we may
<pb facs="tcp:21898:160"/>finde matter ſufficient to take from us the carnall feare of future wants: firſt, becauſe we are his Flocke,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and he is our Shepheard. Will the good Shepheard ſtarve his Sheepe, and not make them lye downe in greene paſtures? This confidence in God doth the Prophet ſhew, and concludeth from this ground the point in hand, <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 23.1.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore I ſhall not want:</hi> how then can they aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in the number of the Sheep of Chriſt, that doe not rely upon the care of this great Shepheard? As then the Prophet ſaith in another caſe,
<note place="margin">Eſay 40.11. Ezek. 34.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Should not the Shepheards feed the Flocke?</hi> So we may be aſſured, that the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Iſrael, that leadeth <hi>Ioſeph</hi> like a Flocke, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be wanting to his ſheepe, that call and cry unto him.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the Title given to God, aſſureth us hereof, he is called a <hi>Father.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 80.1, 2.</note> Will the father give over the care of his children, and forſake or forget the fruite of his owne body? nay, doth not the Prophet ſay,
<note place="margin">Eſay 49.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſonne of her wombe? yea, they may forget: yet will I not forget thee, whom I have graven upon the palmes of my hands.</hi> And Chriſt our Saviour ſpeaketh to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>What man is there of you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 7.9.10.11.</note> 
                     <hi>whom if his ſonne aske bread, will he give him a ſtone? or if he aske a fiſh, will he give him a Serpent? If ye then being evill, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that aske him?</hi> Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe we have the promiſe of a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and of the glory of heaven which is unſpeakeable, incomprehenſible, and everlaſting. He that hath promiſed us a Kingdome, will he with-hold from us food and raiment? nay,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> as the Apoſtle teacheth us to reaſon, <hi>He that ſpared not his owne Sonne, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> So ſhould we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that ſeeing he hath called us to an inheritance incorruptible, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven, <hi>1 Pet.
<pb facs="tcp:21898:161"/>1.4.</hi> He will never leave us nor forſake us in this life, but if we firſt ſeeke the Kingdome of God,
<note place="margin">Matth 33.</note> 
                     <hi>all other things ſhall be added unto us.</hi> He that promiſeth and provideth the greater, can he faile us and not performe the leſſe? He that maketh us Kings unto his Father, and hath promiſed a Crowne,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. de verb. Domini Qui da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit regnum, non dabit viaticum?</note> will he deny us a bit of bread, and a cup of drinke?</p>

<note place="margin">Matth. 10.42. 1 Cor. 4.13.</note> for in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ungodly, they are as the <hi>filth of the world,</hi> and the off-ſcowring of all things unto this day. Hence it is, that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.14.

                  <p>Firſt, an earneſt dehortation or diſſwaſion, <hi>feare not.</hi> Secondly, a loving appellation by way of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe, or a turning of his ſpeech, belonging to thoſe hearers that are called from feare, <hi>the Flocke of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a ſtrict limitation, or word of reſtraint, it is a <hi>little</hi> Flocke, that God taketh charge and care of. The Shepheard regardeth not the Goates and wild beaſts of the field and forreſt: it is enough for the Shepheard, that he feed his Sheepe and his Lambes.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point is a reaſon, and that reaſon is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and that promiſe is of a Kingdome. For ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is our good God unto us, that he annexeth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to our obedience, to give us encouragement in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our duty. And herein obſerve divers branches; for the promiſe containeth the Author, the application, the ground-worke, the manner, the object, and the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Author of the promiſe, who alſo is as able to performe it. Many men doe make large and faire promiſes, but are not able oftentimes to make them good. This promiſer is God, deſcribed unto us by a word of relation, he is in nature a <hi>Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſpeciall application thereof to our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21898:163"/>ſelves, he is our Father, ſo that as he is able, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he is willing to performe his promiſe, becauſe he loveth us. For what Father will forſake his children?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ground and originall of it, his owne good pleaſure, and not any thing in our ſelves as of our ſelves to move him to favour us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the manner of it, he giveth it, he doth not ſell it, or exchange and barter with us, to receive the like againe, or the worth of his promiſe in ſome other commodity at our hands; it is his free gift, it is not for any merits done, or workes and worthineſſe foreſeene: ſo that we cannot ſay to God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did to the Hittites, <hi>Give it me for ſo much mony as it is worth, Gen.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 23.9.</note> 23.9. and if any be ſo fooliſh,
<note place="margin">Acts 8.20.</note> we may anſwer them as <hi>Peter</hi> doth to <hi>Simon Magus, Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Thy mony periſh with thee, becauſe thou haſt thought that the gift of God may be purchaſed with mony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the object of the promiſe, to wit, the perſons to whom it is given, to <hi>You:</hi> but to what <hi>You?</hi> not to the wiſe and prudent of this world, but to babes and ſimple ones: not neither to all in generall, for hee hath made no ſuch large promiſe to all the ſonnes of men, but to <hi>You,</hi> called before, the <hi>little Flocke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the ſubject or matter of the promiſe, the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of Heaven, without which, all other promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are of no value. This is promiſed and beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a few onely. And thus much touching the occaſion; the interpretation, and the diviſion of the words. Now let us come to the particular handling of them in order as they have beene unfolded unto us.</p>

                     <hi>Feare not)</hi> The firſt point that commeth to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is the dehortation, wherein our Saviour ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what wee may not doe. This is the ground of all diffidence and diſtruſt, a cauſeleſſe and needleſſe <hi>feare.</hi> This is the root of all doubting and diſtraction, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21898:164"/>therefore he laboureth firſt of all to pull it up by the root, and to cut it off with the ſword of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> This teacheth that Gods ſervants have no cauſe to feare the want of Gods hand or helpe in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things. We need not be afraid to be forſaken or forgotten of God, as if hee neglected us, or had caſt us off in time of diſtreſſe. True it is, when we looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our preſent eſtate with fleſhly eyes, and can ſee no end, nor iſſue out of our troubles, like a Sea that hath neither banke nor bottome, we are oftentimes aſſaulted with doubting, and ſometimes with deſpaire: but when we caſt up our eyes to Heaven, and behold the providence, the purpoſe, the promiſe, the protection, and preſervation of God, we have a ſtaffe of comfort put into our hands to ſtay us up, that we fall not to the ground. The Iſraelites being brought out of Egypt, lifted up their eyes, and beheld the Egyptians march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after them.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. They that <hi>feare the Lord,</hi> ſhall need to <hi>feare</hi> no lacke: the Lyons lacke and ſuffer hunger, but they that ſeeke the Lord, ſhall want nothing that is good. Where no feare of God is, no marvaile if there be feare of all things elſe: but where the feare of his name is, there is a counterpoyſon to expell all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare.

It is the manner of the moſt ſort, when they begin to feele any want, eſpecially in times of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, to cry out, Oh, we are undone! what ſhall wee doe? how ſhall we live? wherewithall ſhall we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our families and houſholds? As if there were no God in Iſrael that looked upon us, or cared for us, or knew our wants. But who is it that gave thee thy life? or from whence receivedſt thou thy body? have wee not our breath and being from God? doubtleſſe hee will therefore maintaine our lives, and cloath our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſo that we may ſay with the Apoſtle,

                  <p>This truth receiveth farther ſtrength from the titles given to God. Is not he the Husband, the Shepheard,

The love of God therefore toward his, is greater then the love of men is, or can be to their Children: he that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye, and ſhall not eſcape his hand, his revenging hand.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God will worke above and beyond all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes, rather then ſuch as are his ſhall periſh, and after the courſe of nature to doe them good, and to preſerve them from evill, who hath all creatures in his owne hand. A memorable example hereof we have in the Iſraelites, while they were in the wilderneſſe, hee fed them with <hi>Manna</hi> for the ſpace of 40.

                     <hi>Ariſe, and eat:</hi> and he went in the ſtrength of that meat 40. dayes and 40. hights unto Horeb the mountaine of God. The like we read before, that is, <hi>The Word of the Lord came unto him, Hide thy ſelfe in the brooke Charith, and thou ſhalt drinke of the brooke, and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee.</hi> So hee did according to the Word of the Lord, for he dwelt by the brooke, and the Ravens brought him bread and fleſh in the morning, and bread and fleſh in the evening, and he dranke of the brooke. But be hold how the Lord tryed him! for hee had not tarryed there long, but the brooke dryed up, becauſe no raine fell in the Land. What then did the Prophet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21898:165"/>of the Lord? did he murmure againſt God? No, hee waited with patience his leiſure, and he ſent him other meanes for his maintenance; he directed him to the widdow of Sarepta, where he was fed in that famine. She had indeed but an handfull of meale in a barrell, and a little oyle in a cruſe, and he ſaith unto her,

                     <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, The barrell of meale ſhall not waſte, neither ſhall the cruſe of oyle faile, untill the day that the Lord ſendeth raine upon the earth.</hi> Thus he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to lay aſide feare, and to ſubmit her ſelfe to the will and pleaſure of Almighty God.

                     <note place="margin">2 King. 4.1, 43, 44.

                  <p>Thirdly, God will ſanctifie a little,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and that of the worſt, and courſeſt ſort, to ſerve and ſuffice thoſe that are his: that albeit they have but ſhort Commons and a poore Pittance, yet a little that the righteous hath, ſhall be better unto them, then all the ſtore and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the ungodly. This <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. <hi>Man liveth not by bread onely, but by every Word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.</hi> Wee have a lively example hereof in <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that did eate nothing but pulſe (a graine that beareth his fruit in poddes) yet were they fairer and freſher, fuller and fatter at the end of ten dayes,
<note place="margin">Dan. 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>then all the children which did eate the portion of the Kings meate,</hi> Dan. 1.15. This alſo we may ſee by experience in rich
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21898:166"/>mens and poore mens children, and in themſelves alſo as well as in their children. For whereas the poorer ſort have ſcarce one good meales meat in a moneth, but keep a perpetuall Lent, not eating a bit of fleſh in their owne houſes once in a yeere, and feed hardly and homely with browne bread, and yet have not enough of that neither:
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.12.</note> yet is their labour pleaſant, and their <hi>ſleepe ſweet:</hi> whereas the richer ſort that fare deliciouſly every day, are many times oppreſſed with raw hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and are neither ſo ſtrong and healthy as the other.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> nothing ſhall bee able to hurt Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. For as all things tend to the hurt of the wicked, and nothing ſhall doe them good: ſo contrariwiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder the ſalvation of the Church,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. But all things ſhall <hi>fall out for the beſt to them that love him.</hi> For what ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perils? no doubtleſſe: foraſmuch as we are more then conquerours through him that loved us.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.5, 6, 7.</note> So likewiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid for the terrour by night, nor for the arrow that flyeth by day, neither for the peſtilence that walketh in darkneſſe, nor for the deſtruction that waſteth at noone day, a thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thouſand at thy right hand, but it ſhal not come nigh thee: there ſhall no evill befall thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</hi>

                     </label> I anſwer, Divers wayes. Firſt, albeit all theſe may befall, and doe befall the Faithfull, yet doe they not come upon them as evils. They may dye of the plague, but to them the plague is no plague. True it is, of themſelves or in the nature of them they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21898:166"/>are evill, and the puniſhments of evill; but to Gods children they are onely chaſtiſements and correction of a good and gentle Father, and that for their further good, to prevent ſinnes to come. Contrariwiſe, to the wicked, they are the heavy ſtrokes of a juſt Iudge, or of a revenging enemy. Secondly, God pulleth out the <hi>ſting</hi> of them, that they cannot hurt them. True it is,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.55.</note> all things fall out alike to the godly and ungodly, to him that ſweareth, and to him that feareth an oath, ſo that no man knoweth love or hatred by theſe outward things, yet the venome and poyſon is pulled out from theſe Scorpions, ſo that albeit they may hiſſe at us, yet they ſhall never hurt us.
<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17. Rom. 6.23.</note> Death is of it ſelfe <hi>the wages of ſinne,</hi> Gen. 2. Rom. 6. It came into the world by ſinne, and is the laſt enemy that ſhall bee ſubdued: howbeit it hath already received his deaths-wound, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it is quite changed to the godly. Indeed death remaineth as a cup that all muſt taſte off: but behold the difference, to the ungodly it is the reward of ſinne, the ſuburbs of hell, the ſeparation of the ſoule from God, and the guide that conducteth them into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments. To the godly it is no puniſhment of ſinne, but the aboliſhing of ſinne, the path and paſſage to a better life, the haven of our reſt, the end of all our labours, and the way by which we muſt come into the preſence of Chriſt. He is become the death of death, ſo that they are bold in him to looke death in the face, becauſe they looke beyond death. For he that will not feare it, muſt caſt his eye further then it; as they feared not the fiery Serpents, that lifted up their eyes to the brazen Serpent. Thirdly, if any meanes to uphold their life be wanting, the Lord doth ſtrengthen &amp; arme thoſe that are his, with patience, contentedneſſe, and inward comfort and conſolation, that he maketh them able to beare them; he layeth heavy burdens upon them, yet he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21898:167"/>ſupporteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his hand, that they ſinke not under the waight thereof. Albeit famine doe pinch and preſſe hard upon their bodies, hee feedeth their ſoules with the precious food of his Word to eternall life, and they are ready to anſwer with their Lord and Maſter, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.32. <hi>I have meant to eate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 4 32.</note> 
                     <hi>that yee know not of.</hi> Albeit they be vexed with warre, yet he giveth them peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that paſſeth all underſtanding, even peace with himſelfe, which the world cannot take away from them.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.8.</note> all whoſe graces <hi>ſmell of Myrrhe, Aloes, and Caſſia,</hi> whereby they are more adorned, then with all the ſilver and gold in the world. Laſtly, if he take away this temporall life, he recompenſeth the loſſe thereof with eternall life and happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>We learne from hence firſt of all,

So from this conſideration that wee are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy every foot to faint, and to feare want and beggery (or elſe this dehortation were vaine and needleſſe) we are to gather, that we may not caſt away our confidence in God, which hath great recompence of reward.

What is the cauſe that we feare the lacking of earthly things, which the greateſt ſort doe more feare then the lacke or loſſe or leſſening of the feeding of the love and favour of God? Doubtleſſe this is nothing but the want of faith. Let them loſe but a trifle, or the leaſt pinne and profit that commeth to the purſe, what crying and complaining have wee? how much adoe have wee to perſwade them to bee conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? to bee reſolved to ſubmit themſelves to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Almighty God? and to beleeve that hee is able to give them more then that?

The true cauſe of our carnall and corrupt feare is this want of a true lively faith, when we dare not believe him that hath promiſed, who yet is able to performe, and is not as man that he ſhould lie, or as the ſonne of man that hee ſhould deceive. Hence proceedeth feare of the loſſe of life and living, that we are afraid to commit our ſtate and ſtanding to the ſafe garding of God, as manifeſtly appeareth by the contrary,

True it is, the chiefe promiſe that we lay hold upon, is touching the

This wee ſee in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who, beleeving in God and having his faith imputed unto him for righte-ouſneſſe, doubted not of the particular promiſe that God would give him a Sonne,
<note place="margin">Gen. 15.6.

If we have not learned to beleeve in God touching his mercy in feeding and in clothing of us, which are matters of farre leſſer moment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, we have not yet learned to depend upon him for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, which are of infinite more price and value then the other.

For as hee knoweth what we have need of, ſo he knoweth, wee may better bee without earthly then ſpirituall bleſſings. What folly were it for a man to be carefull for the garment, and careleſſe of the body it ſelfe? to reſpect the ſhoo, and to neglect the foot? Wee muſt therefore all of us, from this fatherly care of God for our bodies which are tranſitory and muſt turne to duſt, learne to aſcend higher, to ſee his care toward our ſoules, which beare the lively prints of his image, and come neerer to his nature. Earthly bleſſings indeed are ſpeciall pledges of his loue, whereby he taketh us by the hand, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us farther to behold his eternall favour in his owne Sonne: but if we doe not make this uſe of them, his bleſſings ceaſe to bee bleſſings to us, whatſoever they are in their owne nature.</p>

                     <hi>why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou me?</hi> All ſuch therefore as are the enemies of this Flocke muſt underſtand, that they have to doe, not onely with the Sheepe that may bee maſſacred, but with the Shepheard himſelfe that cannot bee overma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered. Be it that they may overcome them, yet it is impoſſible to overcome him. The Apoſtles were ſent out <hi>as Sheepe in the middeſt of Wolves,</hi> Matth. 10.16.
<note place="margin">Matth, 10.16.</note> yet
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21898:173"/>nevertheleſſe they proſpered and prevailed in the worke whereunto they are employed: and when the faithfull, that beleeved through their word, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed as Sheepe to the ſlaughter, they multiplied and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed even under the croſſe, as the Iſraelites did in Egypt when they were oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let us all be like unto Sheepe, and thereby examine our ſelves, whether wee bee in the number of the Elect of God, or not. For wee are all of us either Sheepe, or Goats. This ſhall be made manifeſt at the latter day, when our Saviour ſhall ſever the Sheepe from the Goats, which are here blended and mingled together, and ſet the Sheepe on the right hand, and the Goats on the left. Wee muſt know therefore, wee are either Elect or Reprobates. For as there are but two places, Heaven or Hell: ſo there are but two ſorts of perſons, we are either Saints or Devils. I ſpeake of them as the Lord doth of <hi>Judas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.70. &amp; 17.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a Devill?</hi> Some of the Diſciples were Sheepe, were Elect, were Saints; one of them was a Goat, a Reprobate, a Devill, the ſonne of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſts Sheepe. Ioh. 8.47.</note> Now the Sheepe of Chriſt are knowne by theſe properties. Firſt, they heare his voice, and follow him. This is as it were their eare-marke, as Ioh. 8.47. <hi>Hee that is of God, heareth Gods Word: yee therefore heare it not, becauſe yee are not of God.</hi> Every man hath ſome marke whereby to know his Sheepe. This is Gods marke whereby he knoweth his, to heare him, and to obey him. As the Sheepe are Gods, ſo the Goats are the Devils, and belong to him, to whom they ſhall be ſent at the laſt day: he knoweth his vaſſals by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they will <hi>not heare the Word</hi> of God, nor follow after it: they will heare his voice, and obey him as their lord and maſter, but Gods voice they cannot abide, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they heare it, and he rejoyceth in it. Secondly,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21898:173"/>they are profitable to many, they doe every way what good they can, as Gal. 6.10. <hi>As wee have opportunity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note> 
                     <hi>let us doe good to all men, eſpecially unto them who are of the Houſhold of Faith.</hi> They conſider they are borne to doe good to others, much more that they are borne againe to that end. This is the nature and property of love,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.3.</note> 
                     <hi>It ſeeketh not her owne.</hi> It is a corrupt love ſo to live, as if we were borne for our ſelves alone, which the very Heathen abhorred. Thirdly, we muſt be patient in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wrongs, we muſt not be deſirous of revenge. This was in the Shepheard of the Sheepe himſelfe, 1 Pet. 2.23. <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not againe:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.23.</note> 
                     <hi>when hee ſuffered, he threatned not: but committed himſelfe to him that iudgeth righteouſly;</hi> Theſe are notes of the nature of the true Sheepe: the contrary are evident ſignes and markes of ſtinking and unſavory Goats. And if wee will try and prove our ſelves, and examine others by theſe badges of Chriſtian profeſſion, we ſhall finde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny jetting up and downe like Sheepe, who challenge to themſelves the name, but are not indeed the Sheepe of Chriſt, becauſe we cannot finde the former properties in them. For few heare his voice with diligence, and yeeld obedience with conſcience. Few labour to doe ſervice to the Saints, while they have time, but are idle and unfruitfull. Now it is day, we know not how long it will laſt: <hi>The night commeth, wherein no man can work.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 9.4.</note> Alas, when the Lord ſhall demand an account of his <hi>Stewards,</hi> what good they have done; what will they anſwer? ſhall they not be taken ſpeechleſſe? Few can put up the leaſt injury and diſgrace, every one of us is ready to breathe out threatnings, or to diſſemble our malice untill we may revenge, as we ſee in <hi>Eſau,</hi> Gen.
<note place="margin">Gen. 27.41.</note> 27.41. and in <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 1 Sam. We are taught another leſſon of our Lord and Maſter, to be meeke and gentle,
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.29. Eſay 11.9, 10. &amp; 65.25.</note> and <hi>lowly in heart,</hi> that we may finde reſt to our ſoules.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21898:174"/>I never knew or have obſerved any meeke and mild in ſpirit, ready as a Lambe to endure wrongs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of injuries for Chriſts ſake, but hee bare a deepe impreſſion of grace, and a lively character of Gods Spirit in his heart. This wee may ſee in all the Saints as in a glaſſe, the Scripture having ſet before us a cloud of witneſſes, that in them we ſhould behold our faces. Conſider <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> how they behaved themſelves patiently, when their enemies op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them, and filled up the wells, which they with great labour and induſtry had found and digged, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.
<note place="margin">Gen. 26.18.</note> How often did the unthankfull Iſraelites murmure againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſought ſometimes to ſtone him to death,
<note place="margin">Numb. 12.3.</note> yet was <hi>hee the meekeſt man upon the face of the earth?</hi> Hee never deſired fire to come downe upon the heads of his enemies to deſtroy them, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prayed for them.
<note place="margin">Gen. 50.19. 1 Sam. 24.12 &amp; 26.10, 11. 2 Sam. 16.10. Pſal. 7.4. Acts 7.60. Heb. 12.2. Luk. 23.34.</note> What ſhould I ſay more? for the time would faile me to tell of <hi>Joſeph</hi> pardoning the treachery of his brethren; of <hi>David,</hi> paſſing over the injuries of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the curſes of <hi>Shemei;</hi> of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> praying for them that ſtoned him to death; of Chriſt himſelfe, an example farre above all theſe, the Author and finiſher of our faith, enduring mockes, buffetting, and crucifying, and yet he prayed to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forgive them. The contrary to all theſe are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent markes and ſignes of Goats. And if we ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the waies of men by theſe former notes, wee ſhall finde few Sheepe indeed, but ſtore and plenty of Goats every where. <hi>Gedeon</hi> ſeemed to have many ſtout Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in his Army,
<note place="margin">Iudg. 7.3.</note> but after they were once <hi>tried,</hi> there remained few with him: ſo many are diſguiſed in Sheepes clothing, but when they come to bee proved, they appeare to be rather ravening Wolues, or filthy Goats, wild Beaſts of the forreſt, or cruell Boares out of the wood; then any true Sheepe. How rare are they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21898:174"/>that heare the voice of Chriſt with diligence, attention and obedience? The Word is no more regarded of the moſt, then if it were a tale or a toy, as appeareth by their palpable ignorance, ordinary abſence, and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſobedience. Every light pleaſure, every ſlight profit, every fooliſh occaſion, every frivolous buſineſſe is ſufficient to lead them from the houſe of God, and yet they would be accounted ſuch Sheepe of Chriſt as heare his voice. How rare are they that labour to doe what good they can to the Church of God, albeit God have inabled them with plentifull meanes to doe much! Where are they that can ſay with godly <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, Thinke upon me, my God, for good,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nehem. 5.19.</note> 
                     <hi>according to all that I have done for this people;</hi> or if they ſhould, what doe they but pray fearefully againſt themſelves? When the Lord Ieſus ſhall come to judgement, and all fleſh ſhall appeare before him, will he enquire of them, what goods they have gotten, or how much ground they have purchaſed, or what lands they have left to their poſterity, and how richly they have provided for their heires? No, no, we muſt give up unto Chriſt Ieſus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accounts, and that of other things, to wit, what good we have done with our goods, what members of his we have fed, clothed, harboured, or viſited. O what an heavy reckoning then have thouſands to make, when they muſt give up an account of their Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! and yet they would be accounted the Sheep of Chriſt? O that they could think of theſe things betimes, before it be too late! How rare alſo are they, almoſt as blacke Swannes, that will forbeare, forgive, and forget the wrongs that are offered,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.32. Col. 3.12, 13.</note> as Chriſt <hi>forgiveth</hi> them that offend him? but if any of us have a quarrell againſt another, we are ready to purſue it with all greedineſſe, and watch all occaſions of advantage many yeeres ſometimes, as wee ſee in the example of <hi>Abſalom,</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> conclude the ſafe eſtate and condition of the Sheepe of Chriſt:
<note place="margin">Iohn 10.28.</note> for who ſhall be able <hi>to take them out of his hand,</hi> Ioh. 10.28. or who ſhall fight againſt his Sheepe, and the Flocke of his paſture, and prevaile? This the Prophet teacheth,
<note place="margin">Ier. 2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Iſrael was holineſſe unto the Lord, and the firſt fruits of his increaſe: all that devoure him, ſhall offend, evill ſhall come upon them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Ier.
<note place="margin">Iob 1.3.</note> 2 3. The Sheepe of <hi>Job</hi> are reckoned in the account of his ſubſtance: ſo are Gods Sheepe a part of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which he choſe to himſelfe: ſo great is the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy of God toward us, For why doth hee take them for his Sheepe, and let the reſt goe as Goats, being by nature no better? Is it any worthineſſe, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in them before others?
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.12, 19.</note> No, <hi>we are all gone out of the way,</hi> there is none that doth good, no not one, that every mouth might be ſtopped, and that all the world may become guilty before God. Is it for their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?
<note place="margin">Iohn 14.6.</note> No, they are called by Chriſt in this place, <hi>a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Flocke,</hi> and hee is the truth it ſelfe that ſpeaketh it. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſheweth, that the Lord did not ſet his love upon Iſrael, neither chuſe them, becauſe they were moe in number then any people,
<note place="margin">Deut. 7.7.</note> 
                     <hi>For they were the feweſt of all people,</hi> Deut. 7.7. Is it for their ſtrength, might, and power they have?
<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.5, 6.</note> No, he found them weake and <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in their blood,</hi> none eye pittied them to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon them; ſo that wee may not ſay in our hearts,
<note place="margin">Deut. 8.17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>My power</hi> and the might of mine hand hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me this wealth, but wee muſt remember the Lord our God, for it is he from whom wee receive all good things. What then? is it becauſe we are more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? The Iſraelites are charged not to ſpeake ſo in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21898:175"/>their hearts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.4, 5.
<note place="margin">Deut. 9.4, 5.</note> becauſe <hi>It was not for their righteouſneſſe or uprightneſſe of heart that they entred to poſſeſſe the Land,</hi> but for the wickedneſſe of thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were driven out before them. Who is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſonnes of men, that will not ſpend land, and limme, and life it ſelfe, to defend that which hee hath bought and purchaſed with a great price, and at a deare rate? And will not God defend and avenge his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom he knew to be his before the foundation of the world was laid, though they bee oppreſſed for a time, and he beare long with the veſſels of wrath, who cry out againſt them, Downe with them, downe with them, even to the ground?
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19. Rom. 11.1, 2, 3</note> howbeit <hi>the foundation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſure, and hath this ſeale, The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> and hee will not caſt off the care of them for ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> here is matter offered unto us to ſtirre our hearts to thankſgiving, conſidering the infinite mercy of God toward us, who hath vouchſafed to make choiſe of us to be his Sheepe, paſſing by ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in the world. Of this duty the Prophet putteth us in minde, ariſing from this doctrine, Pſal. 100.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 100.3, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>It is the Lord that hath made us, and not we ourſelves: for we are his people, and the Sheepe of his paſture.</hi> What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth? he maketh this uſe thereupon, <hi>Enter into his Gates with thankeſgiving, and into his Courts with praiſe, be thankefull unto him, and bleſſe his Name.</hi> It is no ſmall token of his love toward us, to make us to be his Sheep, that are by nature Lyons, Leopards, Beares, Bulls, Dogs,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.12, 13, 16, 21. Matth. 15.26.</note> Wolves, and wild Beaſts, and what not? Is not his love (who loved us firſt) worth our love to him againe? If it be a great bleſſing, that we are made to bee reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, how much greater is it to be received and regarded as his owne inheritance, then which nothing is dearer to him, nothing ought to be better to us? The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21898:176"/>unfaithfull are the worke of God by naturall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they are the new-worke of God by ſpirituall regeneration. It is not our owne free will that can frame and faſhion us to be the people of God, for then we might ſay, It is we our ſelves that have made us, and not the Lord.
<note place="margin">Particular branches of thankfulneſſe.</note> This thankfulneſſe conſiſteth not in words onely, but in divers other particular branches noted by the Prophet in that place. Firſt, let us give to him our hearts, that our tongues may bee guided thereby: let us firſt offer him all that is within us, and then all that is without us will follow alſo; for other worſhip God accepteth not. In vaine they worſhip him,
<note place="margin">Matth. 15.8.</note> that <hi>draw neere unto him with their mouth, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with their lippes,</hi> when their hearts are farre from him. Secondly, we muſt never bee aſhamed to praiſe the Lord, and to confeſſe his wonderfull workes to the children of men. We ſee how men are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſinne before the Lord, openly, publikely, proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, preſumptuouſly, and prophanely, and they bluſh at nothing but at godlineſſe, prayer, profeſſion, hearing the Word, and ſuch like workes of Chriſtian piety. Theſe men <hi>glory in their owne ſhame,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.19. Ier. 6.15.</note> but they are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their glory, nay of Gods glory, and even of their owne good. Thirdly, the ſervice which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to God, wee muſt yeeld willingly, readily, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.6.</note> and with a glad heart, for hee <hi>loveth a cheerefull giver.</hi> Thankes conſtrained, or wrung and wreſted from us, are rejected of God. Wee muſt give unto him backe againe, as he giveth to us. But how is that? and in what manner beſtoweth he upon us? hee giveth us his gifts freely, we muſt therefore returne to him our thankes frankly. Laſtly, he calleth us to the aſſembly of his Saints, which he nameth the <hi>Court and preſence of God,</hi> which was the place appointed for his publike ſervice and worſhip. Indeed God is not confined to a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21898:176"/>certaine place,
<note place="margin">Act. 7.48. Iohn 4.21.</note> neither is there any place wherein he is not to bee worſhipped: nevertheleſſe, ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with true faith, muſt follow the communion of the Saints, as Sheepe that feed not alone, but with their fellowes. Gods Sheepe and ſervants muſt ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the publike Aſſemblies, being publikely thankefull for publike benefits received at his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hands,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.10.</note> conſidering that <hi>one day in</hi> (a) <hi>his Courts is better then a thouſandelſewhere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> all that are Paſtors and Teachers under Chriſt are bound to feed the Flocke that dependeth upon them. They are Vnder-ſhepheards, as it were Chriſts Vicars or Curates: hee is the great Shepheard of our ſoules, to whom the reſt muſt be ſubject, for the Sheepe are his. This uſe is gathered from the exhortation that <hi>Paul</hi> giveth to the Elders of Epheſus, Act. 20. <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, and to all the Flocke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> 
                     <hi>over the which the holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which hee hath purchaſed with his owne blood.</hi> Where he reaſoneth thus, It is the Flock of God, therefore feed it: for hee maketh the Church of God and the Flocke of God all one. So when the Lord Ieſus aſcended, and led captivity captive, hee gave gifts to men, and appointed Vnder-paſtors and Vnder-teachers,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.11.</note> for the worke of the miniſtery, and the edification of the whole body. This is the charge hee gave to <hi>Peter, To feed his Sheepe:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Feed them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are my Sheepe.
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.2.</note> Now as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to <hi>Timothy;</hi> The things that thou haſt learned of me, the ſame commit to faithfull men, who ſhall bee able to teach others alſo: ſo <hi>Peter</hi> having received ſo earneſt a charge himſelfe, is carefull to deliver the ſame to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, himſelfe an Elder, to the Elders, 1 Pet. 5.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Feed the Flocke of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but willingly: not for filthy lucre,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21898:177"/>but of a ready minde, &amp;c.</hi> And that we may performe this the better, we muſt conſider that we are ſundry wayes provoked to our duties by this title. For as wee have ſhewed that the people muſt reſemble the Sheep,
<note place="margin">Wherein the Miniſter is to reſemble a Shepheard. Matth. 18.12.</note> ſo we muſt remember that ſpirituall Paſtors and Teachers muſt be like to other Shepheards, beſtowing great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and paines among the ſheepe, for that is not an idle calling. Firſt, the Shepheard overſeeth the whole flocke in generall, and every part in particular; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as to overlooke one, and overſlip another, is the part of a looſe and careleſſe Shepheard. Thus muſt the Miniſter of God looke to all, and exempt himſelfe from inſtructing of none that are of his fold. For as the ſoule quickneth every member of the body from the higheſt to the loweſt, from the greateſt to the leaſt: ſo muſt he ſeeke the good of all, both high and low, great and ſmall, one and other, ſo farre as lyeth in him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. Hence it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> willeth the Elders to take heed to <hi>all</hi> the flocke. Whoſoever ſcorneth in his dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per skill to ſtoope downe to teach the leaſt, the loweſt, the pooreſt, the ſimpleſt, &amp; to be familiar with them to win them to God, ſerveth not his Maſter Chriſt, neither ſavoureth of his Spirit,
<note place="margin">Comment. on Numb. pag. 699.</note> but rather of the ſpirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. But of this more at large elſewhere. Secondly, the Shepheard looketh to the lambes as wel as to the ſheep, which are as the hope of the flocke, as we ſee in <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 33.13. So is the Miniſter to teach the youth, that he may have comfort of them in their age, as <hi>Moſes</hi> would not goe out of Egypt without <hi>their little ones</hi> to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifice to the Lord,
<note place="margin">Exod. 10.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Exo.</hi> 10.9. As Chriſt willeth the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to ſuffer <hi>little children</hi> to come unto him,
<note place="margin">Mark. 10.14.</note> becauſe to ſuch belongeth the Kingdome of God, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.14. And he willeth <hi>Peter</hi> to feed his <hi>Lambes</hi> as well as his Sheepe,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 21.15. Prov. 22.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15. If a child bee taught <hi>what trade to take when he is young,</hi> he will not forget it when hee is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21898:177"/>old; as a veſſell retaineth the taſte of that liquor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was ſeaſoned when it was new. Thirdly, wee ſee that as the Shepheard feedeth the flocke, ſo it fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him againe, whereby the Miniſter of the Word hath warrant to live of the Goſpell, as he preacheth the Goſpel. This ſimilitude is preſſed by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>Who goeth a warfare any time at his owne charges?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.7.</note> 
                     <hi>who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the flocke?</hi> If we feed the flocke, we have warrant to be fed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? but we have no power and authority given us from God <hi>to eate</hi> thereof, if we labour not.

What then? is there nothing required on our behalfe? Yes doubtleſſe, for we have no promiſe of earthly things,
<note place="margin">Matth. 6 32.</note> except we ſeeke firſt of all the Kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe. If our chiefeſt care be of heavenly things, all theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things ſhall be added unto us. And this muſt bee our chiefeſt care for theſe cauſes. Firſt, the ſoule is of more excelelnt price then the body by many degrees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. and draweth neerer to the nature of God, becauſe it is a Spirit immortall, and inviſible. Secondly, corporall and earthly bleſſings are common bleſſings,
<note place="margin">Luke 12.16. &amp; 16.19, 23. &amp; 18.18, 23.</note> the ungodly are partakers of them as well as the godly, nay oftentimes they have the greateſt ſhare and portion of them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.16. &amp; 16.19. &amp; 18.23.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21898:179"/>Thirdly, temporall bleſſings ſerve onely for this preſent life, but ſpirituall belong to the life to come.

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.18.</note> 2 Cor. 4. <hi>For the things that are ſeene, are temporall, but the things that are not ſeene, are eternall.</hi> Fourthly, we may have earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſings, and yet they may lie dead by us, and wee have no uſe at all of them, either to our ſelves or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: it is not ſo with heavenly bleſſings, ſuch as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe them, alwaies doe good with them. Fiftly, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things are ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſo that without them we cannot be ſaved: the other not ſo. For albeit they be required for the uſe of this life, yet they are not neceſſarily requiſite to bring us to ſalvation. Nay, ſometimes through the abuſe of them, and ſometimes through the want of a ſpeciall ſanctifying grace, they become hindrances, and clogs, and ſnares, and thornes unto us, as lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the world teacheth. Laſtly, ſpirituall bleſſings once received ſhall never bee taken away from us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>his owne,</hi>

Theſe two points laſt remembred, are concluded out of the words of Chriſt himſelfe,
<note place="margin">Luke 10.42.</note> 
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. touching the <hi>neceſſity</hi> and perpetuity of ſpirituall graces; as for temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, they are indeed convenient and profitable, but not ſimply neceſſary, ſo that we may be ſaved without them, as many are condemned with them. For the ſoule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21898:179"/>that wanted them, and the ſoule of the rich man to hell and torments that had them. Laſtly, we are moved to ſeeke Gods Kingdome before and above all earthly things, becauſe as earthly things are Gods gifts, ſo they belong rightly and properly to the faithfull. They onely have the promiſe, that they ſhall not want, and therefore they have the trueſt title and tenure whereby they hold them, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.13. This made the Prophet ſay, Pſal. 37.25. <hi>I have beene yong, and now am old,</hi>

                     <hi>yet have I not ſeene the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging bread.</hi> The Lord hath made no ſuch promiſe to ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. True it is, they have earthly bleſſings often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more then the godly, to make them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but they have them not by vertue of his promiſe. For where hath hee given to them any ſuch promiſe? or how can they ſhew us their charter? nay, they and their children have a contrary judgement wayting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,

Can there be a better or truer title then Gods gift, by which Iſrael poſſeſſed the Land of Canaan? or can there be a meaner or worſer hold, then to uſurpe that which is not their owne, as the theefe doth the true mans purſe? All that the godly man hath, is his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold touching the Conſcience,
<note place="margin">Iohn 8.36. Gal. 4.26.</note> as themſelves are <hi>made free by the Sonne,</hi> and as his ſervice is perfect freedome: his food is free, his houſe and land (if hee have any) is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21898:180"/>free, his dwelling is free, all that he putteth on, or any way belongeth unto him, is of a free tenure. Howbeit underſtand thus much, that this freedome of the faith full exempteth them not from Princes lawes, but is wholy ſpirituall; and this is their advantage, that which they have, is their owne, and they may uſe it to their comfort. For they have an intereſt both from God and man; from Heaven and earth, to enjoy the things of this life. It is not ſo with the ungodly, who are in bondage to ſinne, to Satan, to their owne luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which bringeth all that they poſſeſſe into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with them. True it is, they may ſhew their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from men, and bring forth their evidences, or leaſes, their writings and ſeales, their bonds and inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but what is all this to their right and claime from God, and to a ſound ſanctified uſe of them before him? For the bondage of their perſons bringeth with it the bondage of their poſſeſſions. All therefore that they have and hold, is a bad and a bond hold. They can fetch their title no further then from men, and from their courts and cuſtomes. Howſoever ſuch are ready to cry out with the Iewes,

Such are the congregations of the Papiſts, the meetings of the Arrians, Anabaptiſts, Libertines, Familiſts, Antinomies, Tritheits, Samoſatenians, Swink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieldians, all which are falſe Churches, ſome like the Iſraelites or ten tribes, after they were fallen from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and others worſe: all of them no true Churches of God, but multitudes of horrible Infidels, deteſtable Idolaters, and abominable Heretickes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the true Church, with whom wee muſt hold no communion, with whom wee muſt have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe, but rather ſhun them, and ſeparate from them, nay abhorre and abjure them, as men that walke in the path-way that leadeth to death and deſtruction. A man will not willingly goe into an infectious houſe, but theſe aſſemblies are a rout and receptacle of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and prophane perſons, who have made ſhipwracke of faith and of a good conſcience. Hence it is that the Church ſpeaketh in reſpect of ſuch,
<note place="margin">Cant. 1.7.</note> Cant. 1.7. <hi>Why ſhould I be as one that turneth aſide by the flockes of thy companions?</hi> ſhe meaneth ſwarmes of Idolaters, heapes of falſe Worſhippers, and ſocieties of Schiſmatickes and Heretikes,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.17.</note> whoſe doctrine <hi>fretteth as a canker,</hi> ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as a leaven, and ſpreadeth as a leproſie over the whole body. Therefore hee calleth theſe evill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <hi>flockes,</hi> becauſe they are many in number, and not that one <hi>flocke,</hi> which hath Chriſt Ieſus to be the onely Maſter, the onely Shepheard, the onely Teacher of the true ſervice of God. There alwaies have bene, and now are,
<note place="margin">Revel. 3.9.</note> ſuch as are no other, nor no better then <hi>the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan,</hi> who ſay they are virgins, but are harlots: who ſay they are <hi>Jewes,</hi> that is, the true Church and people of God, and are not, but doe lye.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Church being but one, this point and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21898:182"/>principle is to be holden, that there is no ſalvation out of the Church, as there is no condemnation to them that are of the Church, and conſequently every one that looketh to bee ſaved by Chriſt, muſt neceſſarily range himſelfe in that number, that ſo he may become a member and Citizen of this one Catholike Church. For as out of the Sheepfold are Goats, Dogs, Swine, Wolves, and ſuch like,
<note place="margin">Revel. 21.15.</note> ſo out of the Church are <hi>Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Whore mongers, and Murtherers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh lies,</hi> Revel. 22. Such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they may be in the Church for a ſeaſon, yet are not of the Church, for they remaine not in it. They that were not in the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> periſhed in the waters: ſo out of the Church, and out of this flocke and ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold all are condemned. Hence it is that <hi>Luke</hi> teacheth,
<note place="margin">Acts 2.47. Cant. 4.12.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord added to the Church from day to day ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> So <hi>Salomon,</hi> Cant. 4. <hi>A garden incloſed is my Siſter, my Spouſe, a Spring ſhut up, a Fountaine ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> This is plaine in theſe foure reſpects. Firſt,
<note place="margin">Why there is no ſalvation out of the Church.</note> becauſe Chriſt Ieſus is the onely head of the Church, by whom all parts as by certaine joynts and ſinewes are knit and coupled together: but out of the militant Church there is no Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Revel. 1.13.</note> for he alwaies <hi>walketh in the midſt of the ſeven golden Candleſtickes:</hi> out of the Church there is no faith in Chriſt, no obedience to Chriſt, no juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Chriſt. This reaſon may bee thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<q>
                        <l>Where no Saviour is, there can be no ſalvation.</l>
                        <l>But out of the Church there is no Saviour: Therefore</l>
                        <l>Out of the Church there can be no ſalvation.</l>
                     </q> So then where no head is to quicken or make alive, there can be no body or members that are alive: but out of the Church there is no head to quicken or make alive: therefore there is no body or members quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or made alive, but dead members which are ſo
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21898:183"/>onely in name.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, out of the Church who ruleth as King,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4. Epheſ. 2.2.</note> but the <hi>prince of the aire, and god of this world,</hi> that ruleth in the hearts of the children of diſobedience? and therefore ſuch as are juſtly caſt out of the Church by the cenſure of excommunication, and cut off by that ſpirituall ſword of diſcipline,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.5. 1 Tim. 1.20.</note> are ſaid <hi>to be delivered to Satan, that they might learne not to blaſpheme,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. 1 Tim. 1.20. This reaſon may be thus framed.
<q>
                        <l>Where Satan ruleth, nothing beareth ſway but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:</l>
                        <l>But out of the Church Satan ruleth, Therefore</l>
                        <l>Out of the Church nothing beareth ſway but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</l>
                     </q> and conſequently there can be no ſalvation.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, out of the Church there are no ordinary meanes to come to ſalvation. Now what are the meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſalvation? They are theſe, Hearing, Faith, Prayer, the Sacraments, and ſuch like. But out of the boſome of the Church there is no ſound preaching of the Word, no true beleeving in Chriſt, no devout calling upon God, no right partaking of the Sacraments, no ſincere holineſſe of life, no brotherly communion of Saints, no pure worſhipping of God according to his Word. Theſe are the priviledges of the Church, and the markes whereby it is knowne,
<note place="margin">Acts 2.42.</note> Act. 2. <hi>They continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</hi> Where theſe are not,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> there can be no Church, nor ſalvation. Fourthly, the Church and the world are quite contrary the one to the other.
<note place="margin">Iohn 17.9, 14. Epheſ. 5.27. 1 Pet. 2.9.</note> Chriſt prayeth <hi>not for the world,</hi> as hee doth for the Church, and for all the parts and members of it, <hi>John</hi> 17.9, 14. the whole world lyeth in wickedneſſe, onely the Church is an <hi>holy</hi> company, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the waies, and practiſeth the workes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:21898:183"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, labour to be of this Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and joyne thy ſelfe to it, as a part and member thereof. If any aske, By what ſignes we may diſcerne whether we be members of the Church: or not? I anſwer, It is not hard, much leſſe unpoſſible to eſtabliſh our hearts in this truth. For firſt, ſuch are ſeparated from the world,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and are called with an holy calling by the voice of their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and ſet apart by the power of the Word, as the Nazarites were by their vow. To this purpoſe it is ſaid of the Church, <hi>Loe, the people ſhall dwell alone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 23 9.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſhall not be reckoned among the Nations;</hi> If then we joyne our ſelves with the world, we disjoyne our ſelves from the Church. Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> true holineſſe is begun in their nature. Wee beleeve this in our hearts, and wee muſt practiſe it in our lives, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.5. 2 Pet. 1.10. Matth. 5.16.</note> Hereby we make <hi>our election and calling ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. Matth. 5.16. No ſanctification, no ſalvation. Thirdly, the holineſſe of Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe is imputed unto them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 10.10.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſhed and bathed in his blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. Theſe rely wholy upon his merits for their righteouſneſſe and ſalvation, not upon themſelves. Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they cleave unto ſuch as feare God, and worke righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with unchangeable affections, as the onely people in the world, with whom they become one body, <hi>Rom.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12.5.</note> 12.5. For as they are one in Chriſt, ſo they are one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and love one another in deed and in truth, as fellow ſervants of the ſame family, as fellow berthren of the ſame Father, and as fellow Citizens of the ſame City, with all meekneſſe, patience, gentleneſſe, lowlineſſe, long-ſuffering, love, concord, and unity. As ſheepe will not be alone, ſo neither will they ſort with Swine, or Beares, or Lyons, or Wolves. Let all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therefore be in the Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16. 2 Theſ. 3.14. Heb. 10.39.</note> On the other ſide, let us avoid the ſociety of the wicked, <hi>Come out from among them, and touch no uncleane thing,</hi> ſeparate
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21898:184"/>from them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and have no familiarity with them. Fiftly, they ſtrive with might and maine by ſanctification and holineſſe of life to exceed and outſtrip the deeds and practices of Turkes, Papiſts, and prophane perſons of the world,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9. Phil. 2.15.</note> that theſe may ſee their good workes, and glorifie their Father which is in Heaven. For except our righteouſneſſe exceed <hi>the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.20.</note> wee cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven. Our workes, not our words onely muſt ſpeake for us, and witneſſe with us, that we are of this one Church.

<note place="margin">Heb. 11.9, 10.</note> as the Patriarkes and holy men of God did. For albeit we are in the world, yet we are none of the world: and albeit we live on the earth, yet we muſt not be earthly-minded,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> but <hi>have our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven,</hi> and from thence looke for our Saviour, to change our vile bodies, and to faſhion them like to his glorious body. We live here as in a ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but we looke for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God. We muſt therefore uſe this world <hi>as though we uſed it not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.31.</note> And thus being members of the Church militant in this life, wee ſhall be parts of the Church triumphant in the life to come, there to remaine with Chriſt Ieſus our Head for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Little flocke.)</hi> The third point of the diviſion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, which is the limitation, it is <hi>little.</hi> Though it be a flocke, yet it is but <hi>a little flocke.</hi> It is a company, yet but a ſmall company. Touching the company or compaſſe of the Church, we are to conſider two things: Firſt, the errors that ſtand on both ſides, and the ſtrength of the reaſon that Chriſt maketh againſt all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21898:184"/>carnall feare of want and famine. Touching the errors on both hands, as well on the right hand as on the left, ſome goe about to ſhrinke up the ſinewes of this <hi>little flocke,</hi> and ſo contract it into a leſſer roome then Chriſt himſelfe hath folded it into. True it is, hee hath ſhut it up into a narrow fold, but many have gone about to pin it up, and to tye it ſhorter then he hath done. Thus the Iewes that were of the Circumciſion offended, who went about to gather it into a ſhorter ſumme then they ought to have done: for they contended with <hi>Peter, and tooke it grievouſly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 11.2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>that he went in to men uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and did eate with them.</hi> They falſely perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves, that the promiſes concerning the Meſſiah pertained to themſelves alone, becauſe they heard in the Scriptures that they were called the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people to whom pertained the adoption,
<note place="margin">Rom. 9.4, 5.</note> the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and ſo they dreamed that the Gentiles were quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from ſalvation, and ſevered from the Church of God. Howbeit this is contrary to the ancient promiſe and propheſie, that God will <hi>enlarge</hi> Iaphet,
<note place="margin">Gen. 9.27.</note> 
                     <hi>that hee ſhall dwell in the Tents of</hi> Shem: and hereunto doe other Prophets accord. Thus alſo did the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſhut up the Church into a corner of the world onely, to wit, in Africk,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſt. De Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. cap.</hi> 69.</note> as if it had beene utterly periſhed out of the whole earth beſides. Thus doe the Anabaptiſts and ſundry of the Separation, as if there were no true Church upon the earth, but among themſelves, who in truth are the true <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of our time, as whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knoweth the hiſtory of them will eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For theſe Sectaries were Separatiſts, who had their Conventicles apart under colour of great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in other places, perſons, and Churches, and they imagined contagion and infection to ariſe by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with all others. This is a generation that ſay
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21898:185"/>as it is in the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Eſay 65.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Stand by thy ſelfe, Come not neere to me, for I am holier then thou.</hi> But here good and evill are mingled together, as cleane &amp; uncleane in the Arke, as wheate and chaffe in the floore, and muſt ſo continue to the end of the World. So likewiſe doe the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts abridge it, who faſten the Church to the ſleeve of the See of Rome, and therefore define it to bee a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men <hi>under one Paſtor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 2.</note> and ſubject to the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Biſhop of Rome: ſo that let men beleeve never ſo orthodoxally and ſoundly otherwiſe, yet they hold them out of the account of the Church, and brand them to bee no better then damnable Heretikes, who doe not acknowledge their <hi>lord god the Pope</hi> to be the Vicar of Chriſt, the head of the Church, and their chiefe, nay univerſall Paſtor. Thus Catholike and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane with them, generall and particular ſhall be all one; which Church when it was at the beſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and their faith ſpred abroad thorowout the whole world,</hi> was never taken to be the Catholike Church, but a part thereof, which now is no ſound part or member thereof, being fallen from that faith. For neither did that Roman Church beleeve as this doth, neither yet this as that did, as it were eaſie to ſhew by ſundry particulars. But to leave all theſe, the Iewes, the Donatiſts, the Anabaptiſts, the Separatiſts, and the Romaniſts that thus reſtraine the Church: on the other ſide there are others, who pull up the fence, and digge downe the wall wherewith it is fenced and defended, and lay it out as common ground, and ſet it wide open to the beaſts of the field. Now they ſtretch it too wide, and extend it too farre, who will have all men ſaved in their religion (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it bee, true or falſe) ſo that they bee zealous, and ſerve God with a good intention and devotion. Theſe erre on the contrary part, who leſt they ſhould ſeeme to condemne any raſhly, they proclaime a generall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21898:185"/>and offer ſalvation unto all. They ſee and confeſſe that there are manifold contentions touching faith and religion, but becauſe all ayme at one and the ſame end, and deſire both to ſerve God, and to bee ſaved by him, therefore they hold that their error and ignorance ſhall be no hindrance or impeachment unto them. This perverſe and peeviſh opinion is very plauſible, and well-pleaſing to fleſh and blood, and to the politicke wiſe men of the world, and therefore findeth many followers: the ground whereof they take out of the Words of Chriſt, <hi>There ſhall bee one Shepheard, and one Sheepfold.</hi> But this he underſtandeth not of all men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, but of the Elect onely, or ſheepe gathered of Iewes and Gentiles; whereby he repreſſeth the vaine boaſting of the Iewes, who preſumed that they were the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that the promiſes of ſalvation belonged to themſelves alone. Theſe doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pretend devotion, and thinke it enough to ſerve God with a good intention: howbeit neither are they devout, neither yet have they any good intent. For how unreaſonable is it once to imagine, that God will be pleaſed with good intents, that ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>Who required theſe things at your hands?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay 1.12.</note> or as though the Church were a kennell of Dogs, or a ſtye of Swine, or a den of wilde Beaſts, which receiveth a mixture or confuſion of all ſorts without difference or diſtinction. If God be God, we muſt follow him alone, there is no dallying with him, nor <hi>halting betweene two opinions:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 18.21</note> and if the Scripture be the Word of God inſpired by him, we muſt follow the direction thereof. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion is the onely true religion,
<note place="margin">Acts 4.12.</note> there is <hi>no name under Heaven whereby wee can bee ſaved,</hi> but by Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 13.8.</note> neither is there ſalvation by any other then through him alone.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:21898:186"/>
                  <p>Now concerning the reaſon that Chriſt uſeth in this place, it is indeed contrary to carnall reaſon, and ſeemeth rather to deſtroy that which he would perſwade, then perſwade that which he would deſtroy. For he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this place, to whom he maketh this dehortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even to his <hi>little flocke:</hi> whereby he may ſeeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſcourage them, then to encourage them; and to worke diſtruſt and infidelity in them, then to draw them from their feare, foraſmuch as the reaſon ſtandeth thus, Feare not: Wherefore? Becauſe yee are a <hi>little flocke.</hi> If a Captaine ſhould ſay thus to his Souldiers, Yee are a little Army, and your Enemies are many, therefore feare not their feare, neither be yee diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, what comfort could bee gathered by ſuch reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?

But how many among them, thinke you, were damned for this device, albeit they had fully as much to plead for themſelves as theſe men have? And if <hi>Noah</hi> had never ſet upon the Arke to build it, untill the whole world of the ungodly had conſented unto him, and counſelled him, he had periſhed with them in the waters.
<note place="margin">The ſixt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> What good thing ever was there, that all men allowed and approved? Laſtly, another ſort (the worſt

                     <note place="margin">Iohn 19 20.</note> So doe prophane perſons upbraid the faithfull ſervants of God with this title as with a taunt, O, you are of the godly ones!

But he that ſitteth in the Heavens, ſhall laugh at them,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.4.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion,</hi> nay in deteſtation.

To conclude, I will ſpeak to them in the words of the Prophet,

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> learne that the number of the wicked and reprobate is exceeding great, and the way to Hell hath many people and paſſengers that thruſt and throng by heapes that way. The way is broad, and the gate wide that leadeth to deſtruction,
<note place="margin">Matth. 7.14.</note> 
                     <hi>and many there be that enter in thereat,</hi> Matth. 7. We are ready to follow a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to evill, but Chriſt Ieſus giveth us counſell to ſhun that way, as a dangerous rocke, which the multitude treadeth. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle teacheth, 1 Cor. 1. <hi>Not many wiſe after the fleſh, not many mighty,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26, 27.</note>

The worſt courſes have commonly the moſt followers, and the worſt number is for the moſt part the greateſt number: foraſmuch as the greateſt part are left out of the Booke of Life, and the Catalogue of Gods election. And as in the old world, when the

<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5. Gen. 6.22. Luke 18.8.</note>

The greateſt part ſhall bee given to carnall ſecurity, and worldly profits, without any reſpect to heavenly things. Such as came out of Egypt, were for the moſt part of them murmurers, and therefore periſhed. There were foure hundred and fifty falſe prophets ſtanding to plead <hi>Baals</hi> cauſe,

Hereby then we learne the vanity of all ſuch as goe about to excuſe themſelves, becauſe they have many fellowes that are followers of their folly, and multitudes of companions in throngs and heapes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their evil courſes. They ſay, We are not alone, We have a world of people in the ſame caſe. If this be all they can alleadge for themſelves, and their ſinnes, and their conſorts, woe unto them: for as they have many joyne with them in evill, ſo they ſhall have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes partake with them in puniſhment. God will judge all the ungodly, he regardeth neither might nor multitude. What ſtore of carcaſſes periſhed in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and what heapes went to Hell among them? and at the laſt Day the <hi>Lord will give iudgement againſt all men,</hi>

                     <hi>and rebuke all the ungodly among them,</hi> of all their wicked deeds which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their cruell ſpeaking, which wicked ſinners have ſpoken againſt him. Every man ſhall receive the things <hi>which are done in his body,</hi>

The worſt waies have evermore found the greateſt applauſe, conſent, and countenance of the world.

                  <p>Laſtly, it is our duty to ſeeke, nay,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraight gate, that we may finde our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>little flocke,</hi> and joyne with thoſe few that live well.

<note place="margin">Luke 13.23.</note> like the fooliſh Virgins, who, when the Bride-groome had ſhut rhe doores, deſired to have them opened: but the Lord anſwered, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they know not the Father, neither his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, and therefore no marvaile if he will not know them, no marvaile if they doe not know his Children. The world doth not know the Sonnes of God, neither the love of the Father toward them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their love toward the Father, becauſe they know not the Father himſelfe,

                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the ungodly are the ſeed of the Serpent, that is,
<note place="margin">Iohn 8.44.</note> the children of the Devill, and he <hi>their father,</hi> whoſe luſts and will they performe, and whoſe expreſſe Image they repreſent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.

<note place="margin">Prov. 29.27. &amp; 28.4.</note> &amp; 28.4. <hi>An uniuſt man is an abomination to the iuſt, and he that is upright in the way, is abomination to the wicked.</hi> The wicked hate the godly wrongfully, and without cauſe, the godly hate them worthily, (not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their perſons, but ſo farre as Gods Image is defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) as the old Serpents brood, and therefore account of them no otherwiſe then they doe of their Father.

The hatred of the ungodly, whereby they abhorre the faithfull, for their faiths ſake, which is good: nay, for their Fathers ſake, which is God, is implacable, and never can they be reconciled; it may not therefore ſeeme ſtrange, if the godly doe not onely

                     <hi>and iudge the Angels, nay the world.</hi> There are ſundry motives to move us to beware of hating and deſpiſing them, all of them of great force and moment.

Secondly, the Sonne of man <hi>came to ſave them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 18.11.</note> therefore wee may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them; he loved them with perfect love, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not hate them with perfect hatred, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.11.

<note place="margin">Matth. 18.5.</note> Thirdly, ſuch as receive them, <hi>doe receive him;</hi> and contrariwiſe, ſuch as hate them, doe hate him: ſuch as perſecute them,

                     <note place="margin">Matth. 15.14.</note> For no man muſt bee hindred from doing his duty, becauſe offence is taken thereby, foraſmuch as that were to ſubject the Precepts of God to the pleaſure of man.

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let us not marvaile that the world hateth us: rather it were to bee marveled, if they ſhould not hate us, that hate the Lord, and cannot abide to be tyed to his Commandements, which are moſt grievous and irkeſome, and toyleſome unto them.

Such is our weakneſſe and infirmity, yea ſuch is our love and liking to our ſelves, and our owne eaſe, that we deſire freedome from all troubles, and rather are ready to joyne with the wicked, then we would willingly ſuffer any thing, or be hated of them. We are prone to ſay in our proſperity,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.6.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſhall never bee moved;</hi> and therefore when wee begin to be evill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off for righteouſneſſe ſake, and heare ſlanders and reproaches on every ſide, we take the matter ſo heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hainouſly, and looke ſo ſtrangely upon it, as if

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> give no occaſion of offence to wicked worldlings to open their mouthes againſt us,

To this end, wee are warned not to have the faith of our glorious Lord Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, forbidding us to deſpiſe poore Chriſtians, and to reſpect onely the richer ſort of higher places that abound in earthly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Now, to effect this brotherly love the better,
<note place="margin">Motives to worke true love in us.</note> and to worke it the ſooner in our hearts, wee muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſundry motives to move us thereunto, laid before us in holy Scripture. Firſt,

They are all no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then dead men, ſtarke dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and lying under condemnation, that are deſtitute of this love. Thirdly, whoſoever hateth his brother,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Son of his heavenly Father, is another <hi>Cain,</hi> a very murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.15.</note> and ye know that <hi>no murtherer hath eternall life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in him.</hi> If wee would ſcorne to bee blotted and branded with ſuch an odious name, it behooveth us to avoid and beware the like practice, as well as the title. It is in vaine for us to goe about to ſhun and ſhake from us the name, ſo long as we reſemble his nature. Nay we are like the Devill himſelfe,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> let us ſtudy to decke our ſelves with humility, as with a precious robe, and to crowne our ſelves with humbleneſſe of minde, as with a garland. And ſo much the rather, becauſe this adorneth all other graces, yea without this, grace is no grace. This is the direction of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5, 6.</note>

All are deſirous to paſſe into the houſe of glory, but they are unwilling to enter in at the gate of humility.

                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.14.</note> to ſhew that as a Father <hi>provideth</hi> for his Chlldren, ſo God loveth his, and will provide for all of them. He were a bad Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard that would feed himſelfe, but ſtarve and famiſh his Sheepe: ſo he were an evill father that would bee carefull for himſelfe, but careleſſe altogether for his children.
<note place="margin">The meaning of the word Father.</note> Now touching the meaning, this word (Father) ſo farre as it is aſcribed to God, is taken ſometimes perſonally, and ſometimes eſſentially.

Will a Father deny his Childe any thing that is good for him? God is <hi>our Father,</hi> and we his Children: he our Shepheard, and we his Flocke: hee the Creator, and we his creatures. Hee ſeeth what wee have need of, and hee knoweth better then our ſelves what is good for us, ſo that we may boldly come in faith, and not waver, as the Romaniſts would have us to doe. Now to the end we may approach and appeare before him aright, and come unto him as to a Father, we muſt come partly with cheerefulneſſe and boldneſſe, and partly with awefulneſſe and reverence. And theſe two muſt be compounded and mingled together, boldneſſe with reverence, and reverence with boldneſſe, that we may pray and make ſupplication to him with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent boldneſſe, and with a bold kinde of reverence; leſt boldneſſe ſevered from reverence, breed baſeneſſe and contempt, and reverence ſevered from boldneſſe turne into a ſlaviſh and ſuperſtitious feare.

The name of a Father is a title of familiarity: but familiarity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times breedeth too much boldneſſe, and boldneſſe breedeth contempt, and contempt a baſe eſtimation of God: and therefore it muſt bee ſeaſoned with other

Hence it is, that as Chriſt our Saviour teache thus to call God our Father when we fall down before him, ſo withall he willeth us to remember that he is in Heaven, that is, of infinite glory, power, and majeſty.

If then we beleeve God to be our Father in Chriſt Ieſus, we muſt as good and obedient Children ſubmit our ſelves to his holy Will and pleaſure.

                     <hi>if yee doe them.</hi> The Sonne and Heire will ſearch and know the Will and Teſtament of his earthly Father, that he may not be ignorant what is left unto him. So ought we to doe, we muſt be alwaies looking into the Will of our Heavenly Father, that we may know what is befallen us, and what is acceptable in his ſight. This is one evident ſigne of our adoption. Secondly,
<note place="margin">The ſecond ſigne. Pſal. 119.6.</note> if wee labour to pleaſe him in all things, and <hi>have reſpect to all his Commandements.</hi> If wee regard his will in ſome things, but diſpleaſe and deſpiſe him, and diſpence with our ſelves in the reſt, he hath no reſpect to us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our obedience. For this is not the obedience of Sonnes, but rather to ſerve two Fathers,
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.24.</note> while wee love the one, we hate the other, and while wee cleave to the one, we neglect the other, and therefore God will not be a Father to ſuch. Thirdly,
<note place="margin">The third ſigne.</note> wee muſt feare to offend him, becauſe hee is a Father, and loveth us, and becauſe we love his Commandements. If we feare him onely, becauſe hee can and will and doth puniſh ſuch as commit ſinne, we are rather ſlaves then ſonnes. For this is a ſervile feare, not a child-like feare. Wicked men oftentimes feare to offend, but it is onely or chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>feare</hi> of puniſhment,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note> which proceedeth <hi>from the spirit of bondage</hi> that ingendreth feare, not from the <hi>Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father,</hi> Rom. 8.15. The godly feare to offend, becauſe they love God and his Lawes, and they know hee loveth them againe: they know he is ready to forgive, and not to powre out all his wrath, and therefore they feare him. Fourthly, if we unfainedly take God for our Father,
<note place="margin">The fourth ſigne. Pſal. 119.136.</note> we muſt be greatly grieved when by ſinne wee diſpleaſe him, or ſee others diſpleaſe him, and tranſgreſſe his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21898:212"/>Commandements. No other croſſe or calamity ſhould goe ſo neere us, as to diſhonour and diſobey him. No loſſe of friends ſo great, as to loſe his favour. No want ſo great, as to want his love and protection, and the light of his countenance. The greateſt griefe that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the Prodigall Sonne was this, that he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his loving <hi>Father</hi> by ſinning againſt him;
<note place="margin">Luke 15.20.</note> this ſtrooke him more to the heart, then the waſting of his wealth, and that he began to be pinched with poverty. This was the beginning of his repentance, and of his comming to himſelfe. And as it was with him, ſo it muſt be with us alſo. This muſt bee our griefe, and hereby we muſt ſhew our repentance.
<note place="margin">The fifth ſigne.</note> Fiftly, we may not, nay, we will not, nor cannot be ſilent, when wee heare the holy Name of God diſhonoured. His love hath ſo raviſhed our hearts,
<note place="margin">Cant. 5.8.</note> that we are even <hi>ſicke of love;</hi> it is ſuch a fire kindled in our breſts, that much water cannot quench it: for albeit wee would hide it, it cannot be ſmothered; and though wee reſolve to hold our peace, yet it will breake out. This we ſee in the Prophet, when the Word of the Lord became a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto him, and a deriſion daily, hee ſaid within himſelfe,
<note place="margin">Ier. 20.9.</note> 
                     <hi>I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeake any more in his Name: howbeit his Word was in his heart as a burning flame in his bones, and he was weary with forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſo that he could not ſtay,</hi> Ier. 20.9. It is not enough for us to mourne in ſecret for the abominations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted openly, but it is our duty to reprove thoſe that diſhonour him, and ſuch as ſinne openly, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved openly, as the Apoſtle teacheth both by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.20. Gal. 2.14.</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. and by example, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14. Can a good Childe, that loveth his Father, heare him in his preſence reviled, traduced, and evill ſpoken of, and yet hold his peace, as if he were a deafe man, and heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? doth he not thereby after a ſort give conſent to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21898:212"/>ſuch reproaches, and make himſelfe partaker of thoſe evils, as it were a party, and joyne himſelfe to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers enemy? Or will a good Servant heare his Maſter diſgraced before him, and yet ſay nothing at all? How then ſhall we heare the Lord blaſphemed, who is both our Father and Maſter, and his Name taken in vaine, and yet keepe ſilence, and not anſwer a word? How ſhall we dare once to call him Father, and not bluſh at the naming of him (if there be any ſhame in us) when we have no care to maintaine his honour? but ſuffer it to lye in the duſt, and trodden under foot as a polluted thing? How ſhall God open his eares at our prayers to powre on us his graces, when our mouthes are quite ſhut up and ſtopped at his diſgraces? or how ſhall we looke to have him <hi>confeſſe us before his Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 10.32.</note> and the elect Angels in Heaven, when we are aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him before the ſonnes of men upon earth? Alas, how jealous are wee of our owne names? and upon what nice and tender points of ſaving credit and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation doe we ſtand, to maintaine them? And ought not the Name of God to be much more deare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto us? Either let us ceaſe once to take the name of a Father in our mouthes, or elſe let us ſhew a more Sonne-like affection toward him in our hearts. Either let us forbeare to profeſſe our ſelves his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or elſe let us beare our ſelves as Children, and carry in us a readineſſe every way to honour him.
<note place="margin">The ſixth ſigne.</note> Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are bound to love God againe, and to anſwer love for love. And ſo much the rather, becauſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love toward us, that when we were his enemies, hee ſent his Sonne into the world to die for us. O how great was his love toward us! O how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is our love toward him! were not he a very unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall childe, that taſting abundantly of his Fathers kindneſſe, recompenceth it with unkindneſſe, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneneſſe,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21898:213"/>unthankfulneſſe, and diſobedience againe? Thus doe we, fooliſh people, deale with the Lord, and reward him hatred for his love, and enmity for his friendſhip.
<note place="margin">How to knovv vvhether vve love God?</note> But how ſhall we know, whether we love him, or not? Is every mans claime, and entituling himſelfe unto it, a certaine and ſufficient rule to know this? No doubtleſſe, this is a marke too generall, and may ſoone deceive us, if we leane upon it, as a broken ſtaffe, or a reed of Egypt. If we love him indeed and in truth, we will love him, even when hee chaſteneth and afflicteth us. It is an eaſie matter for us to ſay, we love God greatly, when he bleſſeth and proſpereth us, and when he mercifully ſupplieth all things unto us that we deſire. Such love the hypocrites may pretend, and make greater ſhew thereof, then the true Children of God. This may all ſuch doe as live in peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and yet notwithſtanding deceive themſelves and others alſo. This corruption doth Satan diſcover to be in us naturally,
<note place="margin">Iob 1.9, 10.</note> Iob 1.9, 10. <hi>Doth</hi> Iob <hi>feare God for naught? haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide? thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands, and his ſubſtance is increaſed in the Land: but put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> But we muſt teſtifie our love toward him, that we can love him when he chaſteneth us, and beare the croſſe patiently, whatſoever hee ſhall lay upon us, and looke for deliverance from him alone.

                     <hi>God offereth himſelfe to us as unto children,</hi> Heb. 12.7. eſpecially conſidering hee doth it evermore for our good. And if his chaſtiſements pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from love, why ſhould they not worke the ſame in them that are chaſtened? we have had the fathers of our bodies which corrected us oftentimes for their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21898:213"/>pleaſure, and yet we gave them reverence: ſhall wee not then much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of ſpirits, and live, who chaſteneth us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſſe? Laſtly,
<note place="margin">The ſeventh ſigne.</note> wee muſt come out from the ſociety and company of evill men, and have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull workes of darkneſſe. If wee delight as much in the company of the ungodly, as of the godly, of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devill, as of Gods, we are become one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with them, we cannot be aſſured that we are Gods Children: but he that is their Father, is become our Father; and he that ruleth in them, ruleth in us alſo. This note not onely giveth light to our ſelves, but hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the candle to others, to know whoſe wee are, and to whom we belong.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21898:214"/>which is the maine ſcope of Chriſt our Sauiour in all theſe words, that we ſhould not feare want, becauſe God is our Father. And doubtleſſe if we had hearts to beleeve, and could haue this comfortable aſſurance, that he is indeed our Father and we his children, we need no more, we could not but reſt in his care and providence over us, and proviſion for us. We cannot be ignorant, that in the family, the father provideth for all. If then we be of his family, we ſhall be aſſured to have him our Father, and to ſpread the wings of his protection over us. Will the father ſuffer his children to ſtarve, when he hath ſtore in his owne hand, and can give the ſtaffe of bread?

O, the folly therefore of ſuch as haue their hearts oppreſſed and ouer-charged with the cares of this life, and ſo forget the Kingdome here promiſed by our heauenly Father! The danger of covetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be conſidered in theſe particular points.

For when other ſinnes have left them, this ſticketh faſt unto them, as a diſeaſe bred in the bones. Secondly, it is a ſinne ſeldome repented of, becauſe it is ſo cloſe and ſecret, that it is hardly diſcerned: and therefore Chriſt himſelfe ſaith,

<note place="margin">Covetouſneſſe the breach of the whole Law.</note> They breake the firſt Commandement, becauſe they make their <hi>Mammon</hi> to be their Maſter, they love their money above God, and put their truſt in their treaſure, and ſo make to themſelues a ſtrange God, and commit <hi>Idolatry</hi> unto it, worſhipping it as an Image,

                     <hi>Marke</hi> 10.24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. Touching the ſecond, it keepeth the heart ſo inthralled to the World, that they have no leiſure to intend the worſhip of God. What a deformity were it in the body, to ſee one eye lifted vp to heauen, and the other caſt downe to the earth? It choketh the Word as a rancke Thorne, and ſtoppeth, yea, ſtuffeth the mouth ſo full with earth, that it cannot be opened to pray to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.36. The third is broken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it draweth men to curſing and ſwearing, and forſwearing, in buying and bargaining, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to get a penny. Hence proceed falſe waights and falſe meaſures, making the rules of Iuſtice, to be the meanes of iniuſtice. Such oftentimes take the name of God in vaine. The fourth is trangreſſed, becauſe it thruſteth men headlong to the breach of the Sabbath: they thinke it commeth too ſoone, they iudge that it beginneth too earely; they ſuppoſe that it laſteth too long; they imagine that it is urged too ſtrictly, being ready to ioyne with thoſe in the Prophet,

                     <hi>When will the Sabbath be gone, that we may ſet forth wheat, &amp;c?</hi> The fifth Commandement maintaineth the dignity of our perſon, which the couetous man defaceth. If wee ſhould ſee Kings and Princes, or the children of Kings
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21898:216"/>and Princes, that are heires to a Kingdome, buſie themſelues in baſe Trades, or handy-crafts and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations,

                     </note> (as the Turkiſh Emperours doe,) what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch would wee thinke it to their high calling? God hath made his children Kings, and prepared for them a Kingdome; ſhall we therefore be ſo baſe &amp; bad-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as to follow after this world, and forget the things of the World to come? The ſixt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is pulled vp by the rootes, becauſe this ſinne is often a bloody ſinne, and taketh away life from the owners thereof, as we ſee in <hi>Ahab</hi> and in <hi>Judas.</hi> When a man is once couetous, it cannot be but he ſhall giue himſelfe to hatred, malice, cruelty, violence, rage, and reuenge. It cauſeth the breach of the ſeuenth Commandement: for when whoredome hath taken away the heart of many, to maintaine their unbridled luſts, they oftentimes oppreſſe rich and poore, ſmall and great without difference, ſo that ſometimes whoredome is the cauſe of covetouſneſſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times covetouſneſſe of whoredome. The eigth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is principally broken by this ſinne aboue the reſt. Here the couetous are, as it were, in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per element, and make ſhipwracke upon it, as upon a rocke. They deviſe all miſchiefe, they regard no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts nor Couenants, their word is yea, and nay, as ſtandeth moſt with their owne profit. They ruſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ninth Commandement, becauſe they are faithfull to no man, they are voyd of all true dealing, they ſticke not to lye and beare falſe witneſſe, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in <hi>Gehazi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 5.25.</note> and in thoſe that were hired for mony to diſſemble &amp; deny the reſurrection, and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that the <hi>Diſciples came by night,</hi>

                     <hi>and ſtole away</hi> the body of Ieſus out of the Sepulchre while they ſlept. The tenth Commandement ſtriketh at the root of all theſe evils, and forbiddeth the couetouſneſſe of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21898:216"/>heart before conſent, which is throughly ſetled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. All theſe things conſidered, what a blot is it to our holy profeſſion, that wee ſhould profeſſe our ſelues Chriſtians, and yet live as the Gentiles, Infidels, and Pagans? as Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaketh, <hi>Matthew</hi> 6.32. <hi>After all theſe things doe the Gentiles ſeeke, whereas our heauenly Father knoweth that wee haue need of all theſe things.</hi> If wee ſhould ſee a young man rake and ſcrape all he can together, ſhifting for himſelfe, and no other upon the earth prouiding for him, or looking after him, or mindfull of him, wee would preſently conclude, Doubtleſſe his father is dead. Even ſo when wee ſee men in this world beſtow all their thoughts, ſtudies, endeauours, and practices, reaching and ouer-reaching day and night for the things of this world, it argueth plainely, that they take God no longer for their Father, but imagine in their unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hearts, that he hath caſt away the care of them, and will no longer provide for them, otherwiſe they would not thus ſhift and ſhave for themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of our duty reſpecting our ſelves:
<note place="margin">Our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren learned out of this Title.</note> now we have ſomewhat to learne from hence in reſpect of our brethren. For if we have all of us one Father, are wee not to demeane and behave our ſelves uprightly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly toward thoſe that are his Children, and our owne brethren? Wee muſt be like our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we beare his Image: and not as baſtard-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that carry but the Image of his Image. And firſt, wee muſt imitate him, and walke in his ſteppes that hath gone before us,
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4.11.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21898:217"/>doing good to them that perſecute us, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. That thereby we may ſhew our ſelves <hi>to be the Children of our heavenly Father.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.45. Luke 6.32.</note> For if wee love them onely that love us, what reward have we, or what ſingular thing doe we? for ſinners alſo love thoſe that love them. And if we doe good to them onely which doe good to us, what thanke have we? for ſinners alſo doe even the ſame. And if ye ſalute your brethren onely, what doe ye more then others? doe not even the Publicanes ſo? Wee muſt therefore labour to goe beyond them, and to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect, who maketh his Sunne to ſhine upon the good and bad, and the raine to fall upon the godly, and ungodly. Secondly, wee muſt doe good and ſhew mercy to the poore and impotent,
<note place="margin">Luke 6.76.</note> that we may alſo <hi>be mercifull</hi> to others, as our heavenly Father <hi>is mercifull</hi> unto us, who is a Father of the Fatherleſſe, of the Stranger, and of the Widdow.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hence ariſeth much comfort to all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, that he is become their Father.

                     <hi>Behold what love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſhewed to us, that we ſhould be called the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God!</hi> This preeminence ought ſo much the more
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21898:217"/>to be magnified, if we conſider what we are by nature, to wit, the children of wrath, the heires of damnation, the ſonnes of Satan, the ſervants of ſinne, ſo that wee may ſay, not onely with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 18.27. Luke 15.21.</note> 
                     <hi>I am but duſt and aſhes:</hi> but with the Prodigall Sonne, <hi>I am not worthy to be called thy Sonne.</hi> For what are we, from the crowne of the head, to the ſole of the foot, but a very lumpe of ſinne and corruption? It is by grace and adoption, that we are made the Brethren of Chriſt, and fellow-heires with him, and not much inferiour to the very Angels in Heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. Secondly, in that God profeſſeth himſelfe a Father of all the faithfull, obſerve that with him there is <hi>no accepting of perſons.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 11.36. Iob 34.19. Gal. 2.6.</note> The poore man hath as great right and intereſt in Gods Kingdome, and in this Title to call him <hi>Father,</hi> as the rich man whoſe corne and cattell is encreaſed, whoſe wine and oyle is multiplyed.

                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.1.</note> ſo have all of them a like or equall right in this Father-hood, the low as well as high, the poore as well as rich, the ſimple as well as wiſe, the bond as well as free are allowed and warranted to ſpeak to him as to a Father, as we are alſo taught in the Lords prayer: which is a perfect platforme for all to uſe that come before him. For there is neither <hi>Jew nor Gentile,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3.28. Col. 3.11.</note> 
                     <hi>male nor female, circumciſion nor uncircumciſion, Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Scythian,</hi> but Chriſt is all, and in all, and they have intereſt in him alike, who ſhed his blood as well for the one as for the other, and paid the ſame price for them all. And thus it ſhall be at the laſt Day, when no outward thing ſhall commend us to God, neither birth, nor blood, neither learning, nor riches, neither great revenues, nor golden crownes, nor large Kingdomes;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21898:218"/>none of theſe ſhall helpe, no not the outward calling of a Chriſtian, if there be no more in us. Let us therefore comfort our ſelves in this, that the love of God is as great toward us, as to thoſe that are greater in the world. True it is, all men have not, neither can have free acceſſe into the preſence of Kings and Princes to ſtand before them, and to heare their voice: but all men, even of low degree, have liberty to come into the preſence of Almighty God to heare his Word, which is his voice, nay, they are called and invited unto it. All men have not liberty to ſit downe at the Table of great Perſonages: howbeit God admitteth all true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and penitent perſons, though never ſo poore, to ſit at his Table, and to partake of his Supper: yea, they are the gueſts that he inviteth and entertaineth, and welcommeth, he will ſuppe with them, and they ſhall ſuppe with him. Thirdly, from hence we have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that God will accept of our ſervice and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, albeit it bee maimed and unperfect, and many waies defective. The father that commandeth his childe to ſerve him, albeit he faile oftentimes in the manner of doing, yet when he beholdeth his care and endeavour to pleaſe him, he praiſeth his doing, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by his miſdoing, as if he ſaw it not: ſo it is with God, he requireth at our hands to obey him; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we faile and offend many waies in our obedience, yet when he ſeeth <hi>a ready and willing minde,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.12.</note> and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained deſire in us to doe our duty, he accepteth us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that we have, and not according to that we have not.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 203.13.</note> This the Prophet teacheth, <hi>He pittieth them that feare him,</hi> no leſſe then a Father doth his Children. Doth the Father accept of nothing but that which is on every ſide perfect, and every way abſolute?

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21898:218"/>with much infirmity. This the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> witneſſeth, Chap. 3.17. <hi>They ſhall be mine,</hi>

                     <hi>ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in the Day when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his owne ſonne that ſerveth him.</hi> This ſerveth as a great encouragement to us, to cauſe us to ſerve him, and to put forth all our ſtrength and utmoſt endeavour to doe his will. Laſtly, he will not caſt away any of the faithfull finally, and for ever: neither ſhall any fall away from his favour.

Now it is not ſufficient to make us true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to know the promiſes, except we alſo love them, deſire them, delight in them, and make application of them, otherwiſe we beleeve no better then the Devils: and our faith is no other then the faith of the Devils, for even <hi>they beleeve</hi> God,
<note place="margin">Iam. 2.19.</note> yea one God, and Chriſt, and all the promiſes to bee true. They know all the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">Matth. 4.6.</note> and as they are perfect, ſo are theſe perfect in them; they can alleadge them more readily and eaſily a thouſand times, than ten thouſand in the world. They know all the promiſes recorded in the Scriptures, and beleeve that they ſhall come to paſſe. But let us ſee what faith they have. There are foure ſorts of faith, the hiſtoricall, the miraculous, the temporary, and the juſtifying faith. The hiſtoricall is, to have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods Word, and to give aſſent that the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and doctrines therein contained are true. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous is,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.2.</note> to <hi>be able</hi> to worke miracles. The tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21898:219"/>to beleeve in Chriſt in a confuſed manner for a time, like the man that having a glimmering light, ſaw men <hi>walking like trees;</hi> to bring forth ſome fruits,
<note place="margin">Mark. 8.24.</note> and the fruits may ſeeme faire and beautifull in their owne and other mens eyes, like the Apples of Sodom, yet are neither ſound, nor laſting; to ſubmit themſelves willingly to the Word,
<note place="margin">Luke 8.13.</note> and <hi>to take ſome delight</hi> in the hearing thereof. The juſtifying faith goeth beyond all the former, and it ſtandeth in laying hold upon Chriſt, and making him to be their owne. Among all theſe, the Devils have onely the hiſtoricall faith,
<note place="margin">What manner of faith the Devils have.</note> to beleeve all in the Scripture to be moſt true, wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they goe beyond many men. They have not the miraculous faith: for albeit they effect many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet they can worke no miracles, nor change the nature of things. They want the temporary faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the tree is wholly evill, ſo they can bring forth no good fruits, they have no taſte of the good Word of God, neither ſhew any joy they take in it, neither yeeld they any outward obedience. Much more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe they want the juſtifying faith, to ſtretch out their hand to receive Chriſt Ieſus, and to take him to themſelves: for notwithſtanding their beliefe, <hi>they tremble,</hi> as the Apoſtle teacheth: ſo that their faith faileth in this particular, which is more then they can doe, to make particular application of Chriſt and his promiſes, to ſay, Chriſt is mine, and I am his; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are mine; and belong to me; I have remiſſion of my ſinnes by his death; he is my Father; and hee will give to me the Kingdome. The Angels, that were the firſt Preachers of the Goſpell, were ſent to the Shepheards, and they taught them this leſſon, <hi>Behold,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 2.11.</note> 
                     <hi>I bring you glad tidings of great ioy which ſhall be to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that to you is borne a Saviour,</hi> Luke 2. They doe not onely tell them, they brought good tidings, good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21898:220"/>to others, but good tidings <hi>to them:</hi> and not onely that Chriſt was borne, but that he was borne <hi>to them;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay 9.6.</note> as the Prophet had done long before, <hi>Vnto us a Childe is borne, unto us a Sonne is given.</hi> And except the Shepheards had beleeved, and applied it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they might have beene inſtruments of ſalvation unto others, but they could never have beleeved, or have had benefit by it themſelves, like thoſe that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Arke to ſave others, but were drowned in the waters themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the promiſes of God, howſoever they be delivered in generall termes in the Word, yet are they particular, and every man out of the generall, both may, and muſt gather a particular unto himſelfe. As in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or Proclamation, though it be delivered in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, yet the matter contained in it, is that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to every perſon in particular, and every one may apply the Proclamation as truely to himſelfe, as if he read his owne name therein expreſſed. So then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the promiſes of God be generall, yet are they particularly true to every true beleever that can truely apply them to himſelfe. For whatſoever is ſpoken to all beleevers, is ſpoken to every particular: as alſo whatſoever is ſpoken to all penitent perſons, may bee applied to each penitent perſon. We ſee this in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation given to <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioſh. 1.5. Heb. 13.6. 1 Chron. 28.20. Deut. 31.6.</note> 
                     <hi>I will not faile thee, nor forſake thee;</hi> which alſo is given to others: yet the Apoſtle applieth it as ſpoken to the Hebrewes, ſo that the ſame which was ſpoken to him, was in him ſpoken to all. The Goſpell is as it were a pardon publiſhed to ſinners, and faith layeth hold on that pardon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: ſo that the beleever doth as truely apply it to himſelfe, as if his owne name were written therein, and it were ſaid to him,
<note place="margin">Matth. 9.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> as it was ſaid to the man ſicke of the palſie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.1.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:21898:220"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, there muſt be particular application,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath given unto us his Sacraments, to bee <hi>Seales of the Righteouſneſſe that is by faith, Rom.</hi> 4.
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> Now as God hath eſtabliſhed them in the Church, ſo he hath ordained, that they ſhould be delivered parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to every one, that every man ſhould be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and every man receiue the Supper of the Lord in his owne perſon; which ſheweth that the proper uſe of a Sacrament is to aſſure a mans conſcience of the promiſes in particular. When wee come once to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and to know that Chriſt offereth remiſſion of ſinnes by his death, then by receiuing of the Sacraments particularly, wee come to apply Chriſt and his merits to our ſelves, ſo that the delivering and receiving of the Sacraments is thus much in effect: if thou beleeve the promiſes of life and ſalvation, then take this, that thou maiſt bee aſſured that they belong unto thee, as certainely as if thy name were ſpecified therein. Now then all theſe things conſidered, the uſe of faith, the uſe of the Word, and the uſe of the Sacraments; it muſt neceſſarily follow, that it is not onely a generall notion, but a particular application of the promiſes that doe belong to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> there ariſeth from hence a plaine confutation of a Popiſh errour, touching faith, that a man may not, nor cannot without preſumption, apply the promiſes of the Goſpell to himſelfe, nor beleeve that God is his God, that Chriſt is his Saviour; wherein with one daſh of the penne, or with one breath of the mouth, they cancell all the Articles of the faith, and take away comfort from every Chriſtian ſoule, and leaue them in ſtate no better then the damned, nay, then the Deuils.
<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the faith of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and true beleevers.</note> To this purpoſe, I pray you, conſider briefely what is the faith of the Deuils, and what is the faith of true beleevers touching the Articles of the Creed. For the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21898:221"/>Devils beleeve, and man beleeveth. But as Chriſt tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his Diſciples, Except your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſes, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdome of heauen: ſo may I ſay, Except our faith exceed the faith of the Deuils, and of all the Romaniſts and Reprobates, we cannot be ſaued. For there is no faith taught in the Church of Rome, but a man may have it, and yet be damned. Now I will ſhew what the Devils beleeve, and how farre they proceed. They beleeve there is one God, that God is a Father, that Chriſt Ieſus is a Saviour and Redeemer, and the holy Ghoſt a Sanctifier: they beleeve there is now, hath beene before, and euer ſhall be a Church, a true Church; they beleeve the Communion of Saints, and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes; they beleeve there ſhall be a reſurrection of mens bodies, and everlaſting life. All theſe they ſteadfaſtly beleeve without any wavering or doubting.

                     </label> No, in no wiſe. For albeit wee cannot be ſaved by it, yet we cannot be ſaved without it, and therefore it is not to be condemned, nay, the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth it,
<note place="margin">Iam. 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou beleeveſt one God, thou doſt well in it.</hi> This indeed muſt be embraced, but there is more then this, not to be omitted. Chriſt our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If yee love them that love you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 6.32.</note> 
                     <hi>what thanke have yee? for ſinners alſo love thoſe that love them.</hi> What then? doth he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid us to love ſuch againe as love us? or doth he reiect
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21898:221"/>this as euill? No: but he meaneth, this is not ſufficient, if we proceed no further: as <hi>Lots</hi> wife is puniſhed, not becauſe ſhe went out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> not becauſe ſhe paſed it for a time with her husband, not becauſe ſhe went ſo farre, but becauſe ſhe <hi>ſtood ſtill,</hi> and <hi>looked backe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 19.26.</note> and went no further. So then, where the Devils end, we muſt begin, or rather proceed. True it is, wee muſt haue this common faith, not becauſe the Deuils haue it, but becauſe God hath commanded it, as <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed Chriſt to be the Sonne of God, not becauſe the Deuils confeſſed it, but becauſe the Father had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it unto him. This common faith is a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to ſaving faith, and layeth after a ſort, the foundation thereof, and we muſt have it, not becauſe of it ſelfe it is ſufficient: or we may not reſt there, as if wee were come to our iournies end, but muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed forward in our way. For we muſt beleeve, not onely that there is a God, but likewiſe that he is our God: not onely that he is a Father, but that he is our Father: not onely that Chriſt is a Saviour, but that he is our Saviour: not onely that there is a Church, but that we are parts and members of it; that we are of the Communion of the Saints, and that our ſinnes ſhall be forgiven: that our bodies ſhall be raiſed, and that we ſhall have eternall life given unto us. This truth, the grounds before delivered, are ſufficient to manifeſt, if any thing can bee ſufficient, and to ſhew that there muſt be of neceſſity an application.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                     </label> But the Romaniſts alledge againſt theſe things, that in the Goſpell all runneth in generall, and that it is not therein written, that ſuch a man is Gods, and ſuch a man ſhall haue his ſinnes forgiven, and have benefit by Chriſt. I anſwer,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> whereas they confeſſe there is a generall in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, we conclude, that therefore there is of neceſſity a particular included in the generall; As for example,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21898:222"/>the Goſpell teacheth this, Whoſoever beleeveth and repenteth,
<note place="margin">Mark. 16.16.</note> hath Chriſt Ieſus for his Saviour: therefore there is this particular, <hi>Peter, Paul, Cornelius,</hi> and the reſt did beleeve and repent: therefore certainely they are ſaved by this their application. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Iayler,
<note place="margin">Act. 16.31.</note> 
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>If thou beleeveſt in the Lord Jeſus, thou ſhalt be ſaved, and all thine houſe.</hi> But he might preſently have rejoined (by the doctrine of theſe doting Doctors,) to the Apoſtles, Sirs, how doe you know this? is my name written in ſo many letters and ſyllables in the Scripture? But doubtleſſe <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> would have ſhaped him this anſwere, This is as true and certaine by the generall rules, as if thy name were written therein. As for the particular faith, it is written in our hearts, not in the Scriptures. But let us deale with them according to their owne practice. The Romiſh Prieſts take authority to themſelves to forgive ſinnes, to binde and to looſe; Aske any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſt for his warrant,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.23. Matth. 18.18.</note> hee will alleadge a generall Commiſſion, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted, and whoſe ſinnes ye retaine, they are retained, John</hi> 20.23. And he ſuppoſed this to be ſufficient, albeit his owne name be not read and regiſtred therein. So then, if a man ſhould demand by what authority they abſolve? or who gaue them this authority? they thinke they have anſwered fully, that they are the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, and that therefore whatſoeuer they did, they alſo have power and authority to doe the ſame: and yet neither their names, nor of ſuch as are abſolved by them, neither of the pardoners, nor of the pardoned are written in holy Scripture. What then? May not we apply to our ſelves and to our comfort and ſalvation, that which they doe to others for gaine and for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? Laſtly, this objection overthroweth all piety and Religion. For if we be not bound to be aſſured of our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21898:222"/>ſalvation, becauſe it is not ſaid in the Scripture by name that we ſhall be ſaved; then it wil follow that we are not bound to be holy, nor to feare God, nor to be religious, becauſe it is ſaid in Scripture by name, that we ought to be ſo. O, but it will be ſaid,
<label type="milestone">

This ought to drive us to take heed wee doe not deceive our ſelves, but it cannot wreſt from us this application. What if a franticke man ſhould boaſt and bragge abroad, that all the wares which are landed in ſuch a Port, are his, wil the right owner be thereby diſcouraged, or brought to thinke that they are none of his, and ſo leave to lay claime unto them? If an Vſurper ſhould challenge the Crowne as his owne, and belonging unto him, muſt wee therefore beleeve him, or ſhould this unjuſt claime barre the right and lawfull Heires, and enforce them to give over their juſt title? Or what if ſome ſhall ſhew falſe and counterfeit Pearles, will the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith be diſmaied by it, and begin to doubt whether his owne be good, and thinke they are naught? ſo wee may ſay, What though others doe not beleeve, or will not apply Chriſt to themſelves, or falſely make account of the promiſes to be theirs, which indeed are none of theirs: or what if Satan have deluded ſuch with the ſpirit of error? what though dogs and whelpes lay claime to the childrens bread? ſhall we therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves alſo to be mocked, and brought to thinke we are deceived, and that wee have no faith or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in particular to our ſelves? So then to conclude, we affirme that the Devils,
<note place="margin">Iude 6.</note> 
                     <hi>who are reſerved</hi> in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chaines under darkneſſe unto the judgement of the great Day, have notwithſtanding as much faith as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21898:223"/>the Romaniſts, for they can ſay, I beleeve there is a God, one God, remiſſion of ſinnes ſealed up by Chriſt to ſalvation, but neither they, nor the Romaniſts ever came to make any paticular application of theſe or any other promiſe to themſelves. But what was it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Prodigall ſonne, to know there was bread enough in his fathers houſe, whiles in the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he had no part of it,
<note place="margin">Luke 15.17. 2 King. 7.4.</note> but was in danger <hi>to periſh for hunger?</hi> or for the foure Lepers to know there was plenty enough in the Hoſt of the Syrians, whiles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>ſate at the gate</hi> of the City ready to die? but when once they came to taſte thereof, they ſoone found ſtrength thereby. So it ſhall availe us nothing at all to know there is much good in the Church for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Church, while there is none at all in our owne hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it behooveth every man to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hereby, whether his faith be true or not. And how can we better doe this, then by trying whether we have a particular application of the promiſes of God to our ſelves, or not? Where this is done truly, there is true faith: Where it is not, men deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an opinion or imagination of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed they have nothing leſſe. Now, for as much as we muſt be brought unto this try all, as it were into the field, it is to be feared, that it will deſcry and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a great meaſure of infidelity to be in the world. For how many are there that condemne this doctrine, touching the applying of Chriſt, and all the promiſes that in him are, Yea, &amp; Amen unto the glory of God, to be either a doctrine of preſumption, or the beaten path to deſperation, and therfore are afraid of it, and dare not meddle with it? They will hope well, as the Romaniſts doe, and thinke well of themſelves, as civill men doe, and thereupon perſwade themſelves they ſhall have
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21898:223"/>well. But all this while there is no talke of ſpeciall faith, nor of particular application. Their caſe muſt needs be lamentable, and they in a damnable condition. Such are like to ſome ſicke men, who out of an evill humour, and diſtemperature of the braine, perſwade themſelves that they may not eate or drinke, and that they are unworthy to touch and taſte their meat, and by this meanes are the cauſes of their owne death and deſtruction: yet they thinke they may ſee it, and looke upon it, they may heare of it, and talke of it, and they may reaſon about it, but by no meanes taſte it, and touch it, and eate of it. Thus it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with common Chriſtians, and this is the faith that is commonly to bee found every where: a ſicke faith, God wot; they thinke they may heare of the promiſes by others, and talke of them to others, but by no meanes they may apply them, which is as much as to feed upon them. Theſe are in a dangerous and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable eſtate, like to a man that hath an excellent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and receit for his wound, but he never applyeth it to the ſore; or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. I anſwer, We ſhall know it by theſe few notes.
<note place="margin">How we may know whether we have true faith or not?</note> If wee have the true faith, firſt wee ſhall finde the Devill an open enemy unto us in the matter of this ſpeciall faith. Hee will fight with us hand to hand,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and ſet foot to foot againſt us, and ſtrive with us in the matter of our aſſurance, as hee did with <hi>Michael</hi> about the body of <hi>Moſes, Jude</hi> 9. Wee are therefore ſeriouſly to examine our ſelves, whether we finde any doubts or diſtruſt, and whether we have not many queſtions ariſing in our hearts, which are ready to call our faith into queſtion, ſuggeſting unto us, that we have no faith at all, thereby ſhaking the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the houſe. If we finde theſe wraſtlings and ſtruglings in us, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> did of the twinnes that were in her wombe, it is an argument wee have a true faith conceived in us. This rule is drawne out of Chriſts Words to his Diſciples,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.31.</note> Luke 22. <hi>Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat.</hi> If then we finde and feele theſe aſſaults, theſe tentations, theſe buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, it is a plaine proofe that we have received faith, which maketh the Devill ſo earneſt and diligent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt us and intercept us.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if we have faith applying the promiſes, it will purge the heart, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the corruptions thereof: the death of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifieth the fleſh, and all worldly luſts, our beſt beloved ſinnes, our deareſt ſinnes, and moſt deſired, and thoſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21898:224"/>whereunto we are moſt enclined, and wherewith wee are moſt infected, as moſt conſonant and agreeable to our corrupt natures. This is one infallible token that we are true beleevers: and this rule is taken out of the words of <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 15.9. Gal. 5.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee put no difference betweene Jewes and Gentiles, purifying their hearts by faith,</hi> Acts 15. <hi>which worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5. Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt giveth himſelfe to the beleever, ſo that his holineſſe belongeth to him. Never any husband could endow his wife with ſuch a dowry, to ſay as Chriſt Ieſus doth,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.19, 20.</note> 
                     <hi>I will betroth them to me for ever in righteouſneſſe,</hi> in faithfulneſſe, in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in loving kindneſſe, and in mercy. Thus they are married to him in holineſſe, and they become to be the members of Chriſt: for Chriſt cannot be the head of a polluted body, or of defiled members. As from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt head proceed corrupt things to the members: ſo from a pure and holy head, which is Chriſt, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily proceed holineſſe to all thoſe that are his members. The Vine cannot but communicate of his juyce or ſappe to the branches. There was never any that did truely apply Chriſt, but Chriſt truely applyed himſelfe to him againe: neither was there ever any that embraced him, but he likewiſe by and by tooke hold of him, <hi>His left hand is under his head,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 2.6. &amp; 8.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and his right hand doth embrace him.</hi> The beleever applieth Chriſt, and Chriſt holdeth the beleever, ſo that as the beleever ſaith, I am Chriſts, and Chriſt is mine: ſo on the other ſide Chriſt ſaith, I am the beleevers, and the beleever is mine. This application is mutuall and myſticall, there is a double worke in it, one is of the beleever, the other of Chriſt. A man layeth hold upon a ſtaffe that he carrieth in his hand to ſtay himſelfe up from falling, but the ſtaffe cannot lay hold upon him againe. Or a man claſpeth and embraceth the tree with both his armes, but the tree cannot embrace him againe:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21898:225"/>but it is not ſo betweene Chriſt and the true beleever: we hold him faſt, but he holdeth us faſter, and giveth unto us of his holineſſe, even grace for grace; even as the childe holdeth the Father faſt that leadeth him, howbeit the father holdeth him faſter, and ſtayeth him up from falling away from him, otherwiſe he were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very foot in danger. True it is, we cannot ſay, that all our blackneſſe of ſinne is quite gone, and removed, but that we have ſtill many ſpots and wrinkles, wee have not yet received perfect holineſſe from him. The Moone receiveth all her light from the Sunne, yet is not her body without ſome ſpots: ſo it is with us, though <hi>we be blacke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant 1.5.</note> yet he accepteth us <hi>as comely.</hi> Laſtly, we have the true faith,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> if we hold faſt the promiſes, and cleave cloſe to him, even then, when he ſeemeth to frowne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and to be angry with us, to hide his face from us, and to with-hold his loving countenance, as the Sunne that is hid in a cloud out of our ſight. We muſt reſt upon him in time of affliction. We muſt ſee hope through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, and Heaven through Hell: we muſt behold his mercy through his indignation, yea, life through death, and ſalvation through damnation,
<note place="margin">Iob 13.15.</note> as it was with <hi>Job, Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him:</hi> though he hide his face for a time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us, yet the bright beames of faith will ſhine thorow the thickeſt fogs and miſts that ariſe in us. Thus we may by theſe notes prove our faith, and try the truth thereof. But if theſe be not in us, but the contrary, we cannot aſſure our ſelves, that we are yet come to a true faith. For firſt of all, if we live in quiet and at reſt, at peace and eaſe all our dayes, without any feares, doubtings, wraſtlings, bruiſings, buffettings, and aſſaults of Satan, we have cauſe to feare we have a falſe faith. This rule is grounded upon the Words of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Luke 11.21.</note> Luke 11. <hi>When a ſtrong man armed keepeth the Palace, his goods are in peace.</hi> If Satan never aſſault us
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21898:225"/>to pull downe the buttreſſe and fortreſſe of our faith, wee are at peace and league with him, and hee with us, and we have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect our ſelves. True it is, there may be many doubts and tentations, and yet no faith: but there can be no faith, where are no doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or tentations at all. If we have faith,
<note place="margin">Whereſoever there is true faith, there will be doubts and tentations.</note> there will ariſe doubts, yea, albeit we have a great and a ſtrong faith: for it is not ſo ſtrong, but <hi>That ſtrong man armed</hi> will try the ſtrength thereof: and ſo much the rather, becauſe it is ever mingled with ſome infidelity. Such then as can cry out, What? a doubt touching my ſalvation? Out upon it! O it is a great ſinne once to make a doubt! I thanke God I never doubted any whit of my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſince I can remember, neither yet of Chriſt to bee mine: I doubt not to pronounce of all ſuch without any doubting at all, they never knew what faith mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, it is an evident demonſtration of great and groſſe infidelity. Againe, if ſinne be living in us, that there be no mortification at all,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> no cleanſing of our ſelves <hi>from the filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> we can have no true faith. It is open impiety to imagine, that the death of Chriſt truely applied to any ſoule, ſhould not bee of force to kill ſinne in it; and therefore it is great folly to ſay, We can rightly apply Chriſt and the promiſes of the Goſpell,
<note place="margin">Col. 3.3, 4, 5.</note> and yet can ſhew never a ſinne <hi>mortified</hi> in us. No man is come to that height of ſinne, that he da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth either ſpeake or thinke, that there wanteth power in the death of Chriſt to kill ſinne in us, and therefore we muſt needs hold him for an unbeleever, that talketh of particular application, and yet hath ſinne as a tyrant raigning in him. Beſides, if Chriſt have not united us to himſelfe in holineſſe, we are yet faithleſſe men. For he uniteth himſelfe to none, but he putteth holineſſe in ſome meaſure into them. This rule is expreſſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. They that are Chriſts,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> 
                     <hi>have crucified
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21898:226"/>the fleſh,</hi>

                     <hi>with the affections and luſts,</hi> and are become <hi>new creatures.</hi> Laſtly, if we rely upon God, and upon his love and favour no longer then we have a lively and ſenſible feeling of the ſame, while we live at eaſe and in proſperity,
<note place="margin">Iob 29.6.</note> while we <hi>waſh our ſteps in butter, and the Rocke powreth out rivers of oyle,</hi> ſhall we call this a true faith?
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note> 
                     <hi>The faith of the Elect,</hi> to make ſhew of many good things in us ſo long onely, as God beſtoweth good things upon us, and no longer? but if he once change our eſtate, to be ready to repine againſt him, and to rent him in pieces, like mad Dogs that flie in their Maſters face? This rule ariſeth from Satans falſe meaſuring of the practice of <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 2.5.</note> Chap. 2.5. <hi>Put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> This is contrary to the application of Gods ſervants, who when he doth afflict them, and his hand is moſt heavy upon them, even then they ſticke faſteſt unto him, as the Traveller that claſpeth his cloke clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt unto him in bluſterous windes, and ſtormy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The hypocrites will doe this in time of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity onely, whereas in trouble and perſecution they fall away, and <hi>are offended,</hi> Matth. 13.21.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this is comfortable to every one that is able, though it be with much weakneſſe, and with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
<note place="margin">A vveake faith applieth as truely, as the ſtrong faith.</note> to apply in particular the promiſes of God to himſelfe. Theſe may be comforted, yea, theſe onely, for they ſhall be ſure to finde God gracious unto them in the end. If they be ſtung, they ſhall be ſure to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe they are able to looke up to the <hi>Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> that God had commanded to be ſhewed. If they be hungry, they ſhall bee ſatisfied and ſaved, becauſe they can in part apply Gods promiſes to themſelves. It is a rule that the Civilians have, that <hi>mine is better then ours:</hi> ſo we ſay in this caſe of faith, for a man to ſay by particular application, Chriſt is mine, is better
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21898:226"/>then to ſay in generall, Chriſt is ours, or others: and God is my Father, then to ſay he is our Father, or their Father. Nevertheleſſe, we muſt not on the other ſide be diſcouraged, to thinke or to feare wee doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, when indeed we doe beleeve. True it is, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers doubt, and true beleevers doubt, and yet there is great difference betweene the doubting of the one, and of the other. The hypocrites or temporary belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are like a man that is in a dreame,
<note place="margin">Eſay 29.8.</note> that <hi>thinketh hee eateth,</hi> and behold, when he awaketh, hee is hungry: that <hi>thinketh he drinketh,</hi> and behold, when hee awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, he is thirſty; that he enjoyeth many good things, and when he awaketh, he is diſappointed, and findeth no ſuch matter. Or like one, who, being in a deepe ſleepe ſuppoſeth he holdeth ſomewhat in his hand, and that he claſpeth and gripeth it ſo faſt, that none ſhall be able to wring it, or wreſt it from him by any meanes: howbeit when he awaketh, his hand is empty, and he perceiveth plainely, he hath nothing at all in it. So doe all temporizers, they have many a pleaſant dreame, they thinke verily they have true faith, when indeed they have nothing leſſe: they are without the feares, and terrours, and tremblings, that Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doe often, even in their beſt meditations finde in themſelves, whom Satan will not ſuffer to be quiet.

                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7.</note> and not by ſight or feeling. Sometimes, the heart of man, too
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21898:227"/>full of corruption, will caſt forth doubts, as the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace doth ſparkles, concerning his faith, ſeeking as it were to throw mire and dirt in the face of his faith: and ſometimes Satan is ready to interrupt us, and to hinder the courſe of our beleeving, becauſe he is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more an enemy unto us. For the life of a Chriſtian is like the daies of the yeere; one while the daies are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faire, another while they are full of clouds, of ſtormes, and of ſhowres. So a man that doth beleeve, ſhall ſometimes finde all faire, as when the Sunne ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in his ſtrength, and have a long time of breathing and gathering new ſtrength, leſt he ſhould be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with over-much heavineſſe.

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 125.3.</note> leſt he ſhould put forth his hands to iniqiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: ſo he will not ſuffer the tentations of Satan to dwell evermore with him, and to continue upon him, leſt he ſhould be diſcouraged and diſ-heartned. Sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whiles ſtormes and tempeſts of doubting are raiſed, and the waves and floods of infidelity threaten to drowne, or at leaſt to ſhake the foure corners or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the houſe, that it may fall downe: and we are like a troubled Sea,

Then the Sunne hideth his face in a cloud: then we are full of wavering. Notwithſtanding, this may bee no matter of diſcouragement, but rather of much comfort and encouragement, foraſmuch as this is a token of true faith; and God doth it for theſe ends, to make us more certaine of our faith afterward, to cauſe us to lay better hold on the promiſes of God, and to finde more joy in them at the latter end.</p>

                     </label> wee are not utterly as blockes or ſtones without underſtanding. For our will is capable of good, when once it is wrought in us, whereas ſtones, ſenceleſſe creatures, and bruit beaſts are not. Nay, we have a certaine freedome and liberty in naturall, and civill things, and ſome Eccleſiaſticall, ſo farre as both ſence and reaſon may guide us. But to any thing that is ſimply good, and well-pleaſing to God, before he make us willing, that are unwilling, wee are worſe then ſtocks, I meane, to doe good in a good, holy,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21898:230"/>and ſanctified manner. For not onely wee have ſtony hearts, but alſo we rebell againſt God, and lift up our ſelves againſt him, which ſtockes and ſtones never doe againſt their Maker:
<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.5.

What a ſtirre hath there beene heretofore, and is yet in the Church of Rome, and among other Sectaries (and who is ignorant of it?) about the matter of free will? Were he not a fond man, who being faſt bound in chaines and irons, would talke of nothing but of his preſent freedome and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Yet this is the caſe with us; we are bondmen, and yet we hold our ſelves to be free men: wee have juſt cauſe therefore utterly to aboliſh this name of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and learne to reaſon of our bond-will another while. For we are as unfit to begin any good in our owne ſelves, as the greene wood is to kindle in it ſelfe and of it ſelfe any fire or heat: which being kindled, it is rather apt to be put out againe. Theſe never knew the greatneſſe of the fall of man, and the deadly wound that nature hath received: for it is God that worketh in us the will and the deed. And if both the deed and will it ſelfe be Gods gifts, I would gladly know, what good gift we have left unto us in nature? or what we can rightly challenge to our ſelves? God is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the ending, and therefore all power and ability is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from us quite and cleane of doing any thing that is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21898:230"/>good. True it is, the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> before his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, had free will to chuſe the good, and to refuſe the evill, but by his fall hee loſt both it and himſelfe, both his liberty and his innocency.
<note place="margin">Mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a very bondage.</note> For now our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is onely to be free to ſinne: too free (alas) we are to it, if that may be called a freedome, which indeed is the moſt miſerable and ſlaviſh bondage, while wee can doe nothing elſe but ſinne, lying as it were faſt bound in chaines and fetters hand and foot. O, but a man that is fettered, hath at leaſt a will and deſire to be looſed. It is true of bodily captives and priſoners, but it is not ſo with the naturall man that is unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. For as he is fettered, ſo of himſelfe he is willing and deſirous to be ſo, he doth evill, and he will doe it: he loveth his chaines as if they were of gold or ſilver,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.14. 2 Tim. 2.26.</note> and hath no will to bee raiſed from the <hi>dead ſleepe</hi> of ſinne. Hee thinketh himſelfe at liberty, and as free as the beſt, when he is faſter holden then the worſt Gally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave. He is the ſervant of corruption, and yet hee is offended with him that moveth him to ſhake off thoſe heavy bolts and fetters, and to come out of that bad and bond condition. The Apoſtle ſheweth,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> that <hi>the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe to him, neither can he know them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Secondly, it reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſuch as teach, that faith and workes foreſeene, are the cauſes of our election to life and ſalvation. This were for us to chooſe God,
<note place="margin">Faith fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene is not the cauſe of our ſalvation</note> and not for God to chooſe us, whereas he witneſſeth the contrary. This is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all infants from Gods Election, who are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by untimely death, as corne that is reaped downe in the greene blade. This maketh election to be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and to depend upon the will and pleaſure of men. This teacheth that grace is not the totall cauſe of faith. This is as much as to begin our ſpirituall life at our
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21898:231"/>ſelves, and to give the praiſe to our ſelves, at leaſt in part, and not to God for the bleſſings that we receive from him. This is to be afraid, leſt we ſhould bee too much beholding to God for our ſalvation, and too little to our owne ſelves.

It was not greatnes of wealth, nobleneſſe of birth, highneſſe of eſtate, worthineſſe of condition, multitude of friends, that hee reſpected, who reſpecteth no mans perſon: ſo that when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what we are of our ſelves, and how graciouſly God hath dealt toward us, we ſhould cry out with the Apoſtle,

The greater his mercy is, and the more free his grace is, the more wee ought to praiſe and magnifie his great Name. It is he that hath given us all, let him therefore have the praiſe of all.

They are pure, or rather impure naturall men, that ſet up nature: and they are deſtitute of grace, that pull downe the poſt or piller of Gods grace, which holdeth up the whole building.

But it is not thus with the gifts of God, who is a free giver and beſtower, hee doth not alter them, neither barter them for other, he doth not chop and change, buy and ſell his bleſſings, as men doe Bullockes in a market, that he ſhould be as much beholding to us, as we to him: He offereth with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heart,

For to ſay that a man is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith onely, and to ſay that a man is juſtified by faith without the workes of the Law, are equivalent and in effect all one thing.

True it is, we are warned to make our election and calling ſure, as alſo wee may be, to make our juſtification ſure. But what may be the reaſon hereof? doubtleſſe, becauſe juſtification is not a vertue in man, but a grace of God, whereby he abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſinners in beholding his Sonne, as in Civill Courts, Iuſtification is an Act of the Iudge, not a vertue in him that is to be judged.

                     <hi>while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> And likewiſe of thoſe that heard <hi>Peter,</hi> who were <hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi>

Secondly, we know not the myſteries of Gods Kingdome: for albeit they be the wiſedome of God, yet to us, that are by nature fooliſh, they are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe,
<note place="margin">Marke 4.11.</note> therefore it muſt <hi>be given</hi> to us to know them, whereas to them that are <hi>without,</hi> all things are done in parables.

<note place="margin">Pſal 119.18, 27, 34.</note> to <hi>give him underſtanding.</hi> Fourthly, it is our dutie to come into the houſe of God, the Schoole of all ſpirituall wiſedome. This is the

But how can we looke to have his graces beſtowed upon us, if we reſort not to his gate where they are diſtributed? Fiftly, hearken and attend to the things taught and delivered with all diligence,

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,

<note place="margin">Matth. 18.24.</note> and yet have not one penny or mite to make paiment, and to diſcharge the debt, conſidering that God offereth his gifts frankly and freely unto us, and ſtandeth not as a mercileſſe creditor upon our owne ſatisfaction. This putteth us in minde, firſt of all of our owne diſability, to give any ranſome or recompence unto him: for then his gifts ſhould not be free. Secondly, God offereth and propoundeth his gifts to ſuch as have nothing to give, and pronounceth <hi>the poore in ſpirit to be bleſſed,</hi>

True it is, the graces of God are many in number, excellent in value, and great in meaſure: yet if they were open and offered to none but to ſuch as can well deſerve them, and thorowly recompence them, what profit ſhould wee have thereby?

If we could thorowly be brought to know, to feele, and to ſigh for our own barrenneſſe and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it would conſtraine us to go out of our ſelves, and to have recourſe to God for the ſupplying of our wants. Laſtly, we ſhould freely yeeld him our obedience, as he freely yeeldeth to us a plentifull meaſure of his grace. We have all of us freely received; let us therefore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe freely give to him the honour that is due to his name. If we will not doe this, we will doe nothing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> let us goe to God the Author of grace, and pray to him to give us his graces,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.68.</note> who giveth liberally, and reproacheth no man. For as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To whom ſhall we goe? thou haſt the words of eternall Life:</hi> ſo I may ſay, The Well-head is in Heaven, whither then ſhall we goe, but to God that dwelleth in the Heavens? This doth the Apoſtle teach, If any man
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21898:238"/>want wiſedome, let him aske of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. True it is, God hath a treaſury of his graces, and he is alſo by nature full of bounty, and his hands alwayes open and extended to beſtow ſomewhat: but what ſhall this helpe or further us, if we doe not duely and daily make ſuit and ſupplication unto him? The graces of God are offered and beſtowed: but to whom are they offered, and upon whom are they beſtowed? doubtleſſe upon them, and to them onely <hi>that aske after them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 7.7.</note> that <hi>ſeeke</hi> for them, and <hi>knocke</hi> at the Gate of God to receive them, as poore men do for an almes at rich mens doores. If then we be deſtitute of them, where is the fault of our emptineſſe, but in our ſelves, that never deſire them? or if we doe, it is ſo coldly, as if wee cared not whether we obtaine them or not? If wee did in that manner crave any thing at the hands of mortall men, we ſhould teach them to deny us that which we crave. The treaſures of God being precious, are kept locked up, prayer is as the Key that openeth the Cloſet, that we may take up ſo much as we need. Againe, they are in Heaven, and therefore we ought to be more in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then we are, and to carry our ſoules thither with us, and not ever lye groning, and groveling upon the earth. Prayer is a familiar communication and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with God, and that with boldneſſe, yet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, as it were to binde him to his owne word, that is gone out of his owne mouth. The greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thereunto is the Devill,
<note place="margin">Zach. 3.1.</note> that ſtandeth as it were <hi>at our right hand</hi> to reſiſt us, when wee would call upon God.
<note place="margin">Acts 16.16.</note> When <hi>Paul</hi> and the Diſciples prepared to goe to prayer, the Devill, that had poſſeſſed a Damoſell, ſtirred her up to call and cry after them, and ſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe and deſtroy that holy action. And no marvaile. For he knoweth, as well as if hee were of our ſecret counſell, what we deſire and demand, and what wee
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21898:239"/>ayme at, namely, to gather ſtrength, and get ſupply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and therefore Chriſt ſaith to the ſeventy Diſciples returning from preaching and praying,
<note place="margin">Luke 10.18.</note> 
                     <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Satan as lightning fall downe from Heaven,</hi> as the Amalekites at the prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> were diſcomfited.
<note place="margin">Exod. 17.11.</note> So he teacheth us to pray daily, <hi>Not</hi> to be led into ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but to be delivered from evill: and thereupon hee beſtirreth himſelfe, not onely to corrupt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but to hinder the practice and performance thereof. And if he can draw us to live in ſome open and knowne ſinne, he thereby ſtoppeth our mouthes, and ſtifleth our prayers, and ſhaketh our confidence to obtaine that which wee deſire, foraſmuch as God heareth not ſinners, as we noted before.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> from hence we are ſtirred up to offer the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praiſe and thankſgiving unto God. For as he ſendeth downe his gifts upon us, ſo ought we to ſend up our prayers and praiſes to him: and as his bleſſings deſcend to the earth, ſo ſhould our bleſſing of him aſcend to the Heavens. Wee are oftentimes ready to aſcribe too much to men,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.26. Acts 10.25. &amp; 14.11.</note> as <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples did to their Maſter, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> and as they of <hi>Lycaonia</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and to forget God the Author and Fountaine of all good things. This made the Apoſtle ſay,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the encreaſe.</hi> God is all in all, and let him have the glory for all. This the Prophet teacheth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1. As then the former uſe directeth us to aske ſuch things as we want, ſo this teacheth us to returne praiſe and glory when they are obtained,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.23.</note> foraſmuch as he that <hi>offereth praiſe, glorifyeth him:</hi> hee that offereth him not praiſe, glorifieth him not. The Prophets and Apoſtles ſeldome mention the great workes of God the Father, and of his Sonne Iefus Chriſt wrought for our redemption, and ſalvation, but
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21898:239"/>they breake out into the praiſes of God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5, 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. It is a fearefull ſigne of little or no grace received or regarded, that we are ſo cold and ſeldome in thankſ-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: whereas he that hath received much, will alſo be much in offering to God the calves of his lips. If we can open our mouthes to pray for our owne good, and then preſently ſhut them againe, ſo ſoone as we have obtained our ſuit, (like the unthankefull Lepers) and ſhould render thankes to him for them, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy either to receive any new bleſſings, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the old, having juſtly forfeited them into his hands.</p>
                  <p>

For Chriſt hath made an incloſure, and ſeparated it as with an high wall from the world, as he did the Garden of Eden from the reſt of the earth, wherein the beaſts abode, that it lyeth not open for the uncleane and prophane.

Beſides, this is ſuch a fantaſticall mercy, as pulleth up his Iuſtice by the rootes. If a man ſhould imagine ſuch a Magiſtrate, and ſet him up to rule a Kingdome, as is whole compoſed of mercy, would he not be laughed to ſcorne? and bring both himſelfe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21898:241"/>and the Common-wealth to ruine? We may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo extend the mercy of God at large, that wee ſhrinke up the ſinewes, and cut ſhort the cordes of his Iuſtice. Heaven is commonly preſumed by theſe, to be as a common Inne, in which all ſhall ſtay and reſt that liſt, without difference or exception: or as the earth which is a common mother, in the wombe whereof all muſt take up their lodging. This is a notable illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Devill, who, being damned himſelfe, and deprived of the glory of God, ſeeketh to deceive men, and to draw them into that eſtate into which he himſelfe is fallen. If he can once bring his diſciples and followers to this folly, nay impiety, nay the top of all impiety, to perſwade them that they may doe what they will, and live as prophanely as they liſt, becauſe (forſooth) all ſhall be faved: he hath gotten full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, they are become his owne, hee hath them faſt bound to him in chaines and fetters, that they cannot breake away from him. For who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard godlineſſe of life, that is perſwaded that all men muſt be ſaved? as if the puniſhment of hell ſo often threatned in the holy Scriptures, were old wives fables, to make men merry, or an idle ſcare-crow to make them afraid; or elſe a poeticall fiction to delight the reader. But while ſuch men dreame of ſalvation in heaven, let them take heed they have not their portion in hell. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> laboured more abundantly then the reſt, yet after all his labours and ſufferings, and care of all the Churches, he gained not all: he ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the condition of all, both Iewes, and Gentiles, yea,

The more grievous, by how much the goodneſſe of God toward him was the greater, and the power whereby he was inabled to ſtand the ſtronger.

We ſee how terrible and tedious many diſeaſes are, and what torments they bring to the body in this life: but what are they to the torments of hell? For as all the comforts and pleaſutes of this life, are nothing in compariſon of the joyes of heaven,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> the <hi>eye hath not ſeene them, the care hath not heard them, the heart cannot comprehend them:</hi> So I may
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21898:243"/>ſay of the puniſhments of damned ſoules. Neither hath the eye of man ſeene them, neither the eare of man heard them, neither can the heart fully conceive of them as they are indeed.

                     <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and anguiſh ſhall be upon the ſoule of every man that doth evill.</hi> Secondly, in a ſeparation from God, from Chriſt, from the Angels, from all the righteous, from all comfort, and from eternall glory. A paine and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment no leſſe then the former, to ſee the Saints, whom they thorowout their whole life have mocked and miſuſed, and judged to be fooles and mad men, now honoured and advanced to the Kingdome of God, and themſelves in greateſt diſgrace for ever.

                  <p>Laſtly, acknowledge the wonderfull mercy of God toward his Children, who hath loved them with a ſpeciall and unſpeakable love. True it is, the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate have many bleſſings in this life, becauſe they live among the godly, and for their ſakes, becauſe God would leave them without excuſe, and ſtoppe their mouthes for ever, becauſe he would teach his owne ſervants not to place any happineſſe in them, but to looke for greater bleſſings in the other life: howbeit they have not ſuch among them all,
<note place="margin">Gen. 25.5, 6.</note> as doe accompany ſalvation. For as <hi>Abraham</hi> gave ſundry <hi>bleſſings</hi> to the ſonnes of the Concubines, but he made <hi>Iſaak</hi> the ſonne of the free woman to be his heire: ſo God beſtoweth common gifts,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.45.</note> and many temporall bleſſings upon the Reprobates, hee maketh <hi>his Sunne to riſe</hi> on the evill and on the good, and ſendeth raine upon the juſt and unjuſt: howbeit he maketh them not his heires, for as much as ſpirituall and eternall graces are communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to none, but to the Elect, which ſhall be inheriters of Salvation, and for them he hath prepared the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Why may wee not therefore cry out with the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 144.3. &amp; 8.5. &amp; 3, 4.8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou takeſt knowledge of him? or the ſonne of man, that thou makeſt account of him? who is like to vanity, and his daies are as a ſhadow that paſſeth away, Pſal.</hi> 144. And elſe-where, <hi>O, taſte and ſee, for the Lord is good: bleſſed is the man that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in him! O feare the Lord, ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that feare him.</hi> If God muſt have praiſe for the leaſt of his bleſſings, how much more for this, that is the greateſt of all, wherein the Lord hath enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his love towards us? and without which, our faith had beene in vaine, yea, Chriſt Ieſus had dyed, riſen againe, and aſcended in vaine, and all the worke
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21898:244"/>of our Redemption were fruſtrate; ſo that without conſideration of the Kingdome of heaven, (of which we come now to conſider in the laſt place,) bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings were no bleſſings, and graces were no graces at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Kingdome.)</hi> This is the laſt, but not the leaſt branch of the promiſe, which containeth the higheſt ſtaire and top of our felicity and happines. The ungodly thinke faithfull men unworthy to breathe, or whom the earth ſhould beare: but behold, God, even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vouchſafeth of his grace and good pleaſure to account them worthy of heaven. The ungodly deeme them not to be worthy to live in the world: but the Lord eſteemeth not the <hi>world worthy of them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11.38.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will tranſlate them out of the world, that they may enjoy his preſence. Now as before we heard of the object of the promiſe, the Flocke of Chriſt: ſo now we come to conſider of the ſubject or principall matter of the promiſe, the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of heaven. And in this word we have the ſubſtance of the reaſon uſed by Chriſt our Saviour, to keepe us from feare of falling away from him, for feare of future wants: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have deferred to conſider of the ſtrength thereof to this place. The reaſon may be thus framed, and put into forme, that we may ſee the force of it,
<q>
                        <l>If God will beſtow upon us the Kingdome, then feare not the lacke of earthly things.</l>
                        <l>But God will beſtow upon us the Kingdome, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</l>
                        <l>Feare not the lacke of earthly things.</l>
                     </q> Or more plainely after this manner:
<q>
                        <l>Whoſoever have a Kingdom promiſed unto them, need not feare the lacke of leſſer bleſſings;</l>
                        <l>But the faithfull have a Kingdome promiſed unto them,</l>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:21898:245"/>
                        <l>Therefore the faithfull need not feare the lacke of leſſer bleſſings.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The power and ſtrength of this reaſon is good and exceeding great. Chriſt our Saviour doth never argue weakely, who miniſtreth ſtrength to all his that are weake. In this reaſon, the giving of heavenly things to us, is made an argument to prove the not with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of earthly things from us. Wee may not feare or faint in our faith and profeſſion, as though God would quite forſake us, or give us over. And wherefore? Becauſe he hath promiſed to us the Kingdome, ſo that there is nothing ſo great that he will ſticke at, or doubt to beſtow upon us.
<label type="milestone">

The Hebrewes tooke joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, while they were made a gazing-ſtocke by reproaches and calamities. This is no eaſie thing to beare, but hard for fleſh and blood to doe. For no doubt their goods and good names were as precious unto them, as ours to our ſelves, or to any other. What then was the cauſe that made them able to beare all theſe injuries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities?

Wee ſhould make this reckoning and account, that our life, from our birth day to our dying day, is nothing elſe but as a pilgrimage thorow the wilderneſſe to the Land of Canaan, that is, our journey and paſſage toward Heaven.

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let us walke before the Lord in feare and trembling, who, being privy to all our infirmities, and knowing whereof we ſtand moſt in need, hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this as an effectuall remedy againſt all diſtracting thoughts and troubles that ariſe in the world. God hath not left us without comfort; nay, hee hath mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the greateſt comfort, where the greateſt diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort remaineth. He knoweth what tentations ariſe in our mindes touching worldly wants, he ſendeth us not therefore naked and unarmed into the field, to buckle and wraſtle with enemies that would be too ſtrong for us. For whereas he might have miniſtred unto us a thouſand other comforts, he ſingleth this out as armour of proofe, which is able to withſtand all the fiery darts of the Devill. For as the Hushandman is carefull to make the fence ſtrongeſt, and the hedge higheſt, where the beaſts are moſt buſie and ready to enter: ſo Chriſt our Saviour, underſtanding that wee lye moſt open to aſſaults of feares and cares, and to have our faith batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the engines of our ſpirituall adverſary, reacheth how to reſiſt him by keeping this in remembrance, that it is <hi>our Fathers good pleaſure to give unto us the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> And doubtleſſe nothing in this world will more provoke us to ſtand in awe of God, and to get grace in our hearts then this,

If an earthly Prince ſhould thus comfort any of his people, Feare not poverty, I will promote thee to honour and glory, how would it refreſh his ſoule? how would it revive his ſpirits? and how would it provoke him to doe him the beſt ſervice he could? Take an example hereof in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> toward <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Jonathan.</hi> When the King, after inquiſition for ſome left of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> that he might ſhew him kindneſſe for <hi>Jonathans</hi> ſake, had called him unto him, and ſaid, <hi>Feare not,</hi>

                     <hi>for I will ſhew thee kindneſſe for thy Fathers ſake, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore thee all the Land of</hi> Saul <hi>thy Father, and thou ſhalt eate bread at my Table continually:</hi> Hee had no ſooner heard theſe gracious words, and received this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table promiſe, but by and by <hi>hee bowed himſelfe</hi> before him. Thus ought it to be with every one of us, when we conſider what promiſe of honour and advancement we have received, we ſhould in all humility caſt down our ſelves, and walke in reverence and godly feare, all the daies of our lives before him. The driving out one feare, ſhould worke in us another kinde of feare. If we have not this grace here, we deceive our ſelves, if we looke for glory hereafter.

This is their property, and the voyce whereby they are knowne; they ſay, My converſation is in heaven, my hope is in the next life, I looke for better things. For albeit God often bleſſe them with honour, with riches, with friends, and all that heart can deſire, yet doe they not place their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in theſe, they looke ſtill for better things then theſe.

                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> God beginneth their ſalvation in this life. He maketh them here <hi>Kings and Prieſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 1.6. 1 Pet. 2.5.</note> and therefore he cannot but hereafter give them a Kingdome: And he beginneth their ſalvation, and entreth them after a ſort into the Kingdome, partly by giving them a lively taſte and joyfull feeling of that heavenly glory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are raviſhed, and partly while hee bleſſeth them with ſuch ſpirituall bleſſings in heavenly things as accompany ſalvation,

If hee can give us the Kingdome of Heaven, he will not with-hold from us

So the Lord hath appointed his to be Heires of eternall life, he giveth them therefore all things belonging to this preſent life, and things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to bring them to his Kingdome. If then wee have the more noble aſſured unto us, how can wee, without great infidelity and impiety, doubt of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the leſſer and baſer? For what are all the bleſſings of this tranſitory life better then trifles, being valued and prized with immortality? Let us therefore evermore have before our eyes this promiſe, <hi>It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give unto you the Kingdome:</hi> and certainely being mingled with faith, it will give us aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his helpe in all time of need, how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our aſſaults and afflictions ſhall be. Let us call to remembrance what the Prophet ſpeaketh to <hi>Amaziah</hi> King of Iudah, when he had hired a great Army of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to helpe him againſt the Edomites, and given them an hundred talents of ſilver, when he was charged to diſmiſſe them, and was in danger to loſe the money which they had received for their pay: when the King ſaid, What ſhall we doe for the hundred talents? the man of God anſwered,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 25.6, 7, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord is able to give thee much more then this.</hi> Was this ſpoken for that King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? No, it was written even for us alſo, upon whom the ends of the world are come. For as when he was in doubt, and feared to loſe his money, the Prophet ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth him upon Gods providence, and calleth upon him to wait upon God in an holy obedience to his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21898:251"/>Commandement to receive a greater bleſſing at his hands: ſo if we ſhall rely upon him by faith in all our troubles without murmuring and grudging, this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly conſolation is written for us, and to us, as well as to the King; The Lord is able to give us much more then this. If wee ſuffer any loſſes, or ſpoiling of our goods, he can reſtore whatſoever hath beene taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and make us recompence to the full, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Iob.</hi> For as hee ſubmitted himſelfe to His good pleaſure in all his croſſes,

Yea, what can be more forcible to worke in us pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in troubles, and contentment in poverty, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our ſelves humbly to God in all loſſes and wants whatſoever, then to conſider that God hath laid up for us treaſure in Heaven, and will beſtow upon us <hi>a Kingdome?</hi> If then at any time wee be carried into ſtrange thoughts and cares for the things of this life, it is certaine wee were never well grounded in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of everlaſting life. For how can wee looke for heavenly things from him, when we doubt of earthly? How can we looke for the life to come, when we feare to lacke for this life? or how ſhall wee depend upon him for our ſoules, when wee dare not truſt him with our bodies? Whatſoever therefore we may ſeeme to others, or to our ſelves to doe, it is certaine, wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive both our ſelves and others alſo, to thinke that we rely upon him wholy for the greater and better things, when we reſt not upon him for the ſlighteſt and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt matters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> uſe the meanes carefully that may further

All men are willing to bee at their waies end, but all men are not willing to know the way, or if they know it, it is death to them to walke in it. But if any ſay as <hi>Thomas</hi> did to Chriſt, <hi>How can we know the way?</hi> I anſwer,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.5.</note> Wee are brought in to the Kingdome by the meanes of the Word, as the Traveller is to the place of his lodging by his Guide. Chriſt Ieſus is the <hi>Way,</hi> the Word of God is our Guide, and it is the Rule by which we muſt walke. The Carpenter is no body without his ſquare, his worke can never be right, if it be not laid unto it: ſo it is with the faithfull, he can doe, hee will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without his rule, which is ſo excellent, that it is called the <hi>rod</hi> of Gods mouth, and the <hi>breath</hi> of his lips, Eſay 11.4. 2 Theſ. 2.8. <hi>The Goſpell of the Kingdome,</hi>

Chriſt is the King of his Church, to rule it, and give Lawes unto it: howbeit he is not our King, except we ſuffer him to raigne in us outwardly by his Scepter, and inwardly by his Spirit. All men will ſeeme deſirous to come to Heaven, but they will chuſe their owne way, and their owne guide, they will not ſubmit themſelves to the wiſedome of God,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.25.</note> as if the <hi>fooliſhneſſe</hi> of men were wiſer then God, or the <hi>weakeneſſe</hi> of men were ſtronger then God. They would gladly attaine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and with him in the Goſpell, they account him happy that ſhall <hi>eate bread in the Kingdome of Heaven:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 14.15.</note> but they regard not the Goſpell of the Kingdome. Theſe dreame of a Kingdome without the Word: but this is an imaginary Kingdome of their owne. If wee travell without the Word, it will bring us to Hell, the kingdome of darkneſſe; but never to the Kingdome of Heaven; and of God who dwelleth in the light, which no man can approach unto. No man by nature know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way to Heaven; neither can poſſibly finde it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21898:252"/>without his guide; there are ſo many odde lanes, and blinde turnings, and by-pathes, and croſſe waies, that we are ſure to miſſe: the Devill ſtandeth at one corner and telleth us, This is the way: the World calleth to us at another, I will lead thee: and ſinne ſitteth at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ready to perſwade us to follow it. Wee know the way that leadeth to Hell well enough, nature is a ſufficient guide to inſtruct us, and direct us, if we have no other, we cannot miſſe it, the way is ſo broad, and the gate ſo wide that leadeth to deſtruction, and the company ſo great going before us, that thruſteth and throngeth to enter into it. Wherefore it ſtandeth us upon to doe nothing without our guide. Howbeit, this is an hard matter, men will not ſtoope downe when God holds out his Scepter ready to lead them, neither will they draw neere, when God ſtretcheth out his arme to receive them,
<note place="margin">The cauſes why vve fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv not the guidance of the Word.</note> but hang backe many wayes. And will we underſtand and learne the cauſes that ſtop up our way, and hinder us from following the guidance of the Word? Ignorance, negligence, and contempt have ſo poſſeſſed the greateſt part, that they are a ſmall remnant that make conſcience to ſeeke knowledge, to uſe diligence, and to performe obedience. Theſe lead us by the hand to the Kingdome, the former are the greateſt enemies to our ſoules.

<note place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note> the greateſt part know not the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the doctrine</hi> of Chriſtian Religion. The raine and dew of Heaven hath fallen upon the ground, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21898:252"/>yet it remaineth dry and barren. The Hammer of the Word hath beaten upon our hearts, yet they are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as the Anvill. Many gracious ſhowres have drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped downe upon the graſſe of the field, and yet (alas) it is ready to wither away. The Sunne hath ſhined clearely in our eyes, and yet (alas) we remaine in pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable darkneſſe. O, what a deepe and ſecret judgement <q>is this, that the raine ſhould make us dry, and the Sunne make us blinde: that the light ſhould cauſe darkneſſe, and the ſound of the Goſpell ſhould make us deafe!</q> But thus it is, and thus it muſt bee, when we regard not to know the will of our God. Certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch blinde ſottiſh people, that remaine willingly, nay, wilfully blinde in the middeſt of the meanes of knowledge, like thoſe that having meat before them, ariſe empty from the Table, cannot aſſure themſelves to bee true members of the Chriſtian Church.

<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note> as it were the firſt <hi>milke</hi> that they ſucke from their Mothers breſts, that they <hi>may</hi> grow thereby, they are not yet in the way to the Kingdome, they have not ſet one ſtep forward to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Notwithſtanding, if a thorow view and exact examination were taken of the moſt places, I feare, the greateſt number, even of ſuch as are of yeeres of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be found faulty and guilty, that they know not ſo much as every Chriſtian muſt know that ſhall be ſaved, and ſee Chriſt Ieſus his Saviour to his comfort. And therefore I may conclude that the greateſt number of them yet ſtand in the ſtate of damnation. I will not ſay, they ſhall bee condemned, neither dare I, becauſe God hath given to us no ſuch warrant,
<note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> and <hi>ſecret things belong</hi> unto him, but rather I hope better things of them, though I thus ſpeake: howbeit, this I affirme, and dare bee bold to pronounce, that ſuch doe as yet ſtand through their ignorance in the ſtate of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What though many of you be of great age? what though yee have beene baptized, and beene admitted to the Lords Supper? what though yee have beene long hearers of the Word? I beſeech you by the mercies and patience of God toward you, deceive not your ſelves: doe not flatter your owne ſoules: perſwade not better things of your ſelves then there is juſt cauſe: be not as Children that know not the right hand from the left: be not alwaies blinde in your underſtanding: but rather examine your ſelves, and call your ſelves to an account what yee have heard and learned, leſt yee be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21898:253"/>like thoſe that <hi>are alwaies learning,</hi>

                  <p>Thus much of ignorance the mother of errour:
<note place="margin">Neglect of the Word, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the Kingdome.</note> the ſecond hinderance that ſtoppeth up the way to the Kingdome, is <hi>the neglect of the Word,</hi> a farther degree of ſinne then the former. This is the ſinne of our time, the common ſinne of every place, yea, almoſt of every perſon. The light is come among us, but we love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more then the light, and are <hi>luke-warme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 3.16.</note> as retchleſſe men that care not which end goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. God will ſpew out ſuch out of his mouth, as evill humours out of the ſtomacke. <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth us in the Proverbes, that <hi>he which is ſloathfull in his worke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 18.9.</note> 
                     <hi>is brother to him that is a great waſter:</hi> ſo is it with ſuch as are ſloathfull in the Lords worke, and in their owne duty, they are companions and brethren with ſuch as are open and obſtinate contemners of the Word, and make haſte a pace after them, they follow them cloſe at the heeles, and in ſhort time will overtake them. There is ſuch careleſneſſe and ſecurity every-where, in the matters of God among us, as if every man were left to doe what he liſt, as if the ſoule were the leaſt matter of a thouſand, as if Religion were laſt of all to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, or as if there were no day of account to come hereafter. Among thoſe that come to the place of Gods worſhip, many indeed are kept in awe and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: but how? and wherefore? Is it by any conſcience of their duty, or by love to the Word? Nay, nay, but for ſiniſter ends: ſome by force of the Law, becauſe they feare to be preſented: ſome by awe of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, becauſe they would not be thought ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:21898:254"/>ſome come for cuſtome and faſhion ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Sunday: ſome for company of others, becauſe they would doe as their honeſt neighbours doe, and love not to be ſingular: ſome for that they would not be accounted Papiſts, becauſe the State fauoureth them not: ſome leſt they ſhould bee eſteemed Atheiſts, and ſo be pointed at with the finger: ſome to pleaſe their Parents, becauſe they ſhould leave them a better por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſome to content their Maſters, leſt they ſhould be thruſted out of their dores, or becauſe they hope to gaine by them: ſome to paſſe away the time, becauſe they have nothing elſe to doe: ſome to meet with their friends and acquaintance, becauſe they are loth to ſpare another day: ſome to meete with their debters, becauſe they would demand their money: but the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number to meet the Lord in his owne Ordinances, becauſe they <hi>love the habitation of his houſe, and the place where his honour dwelleth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 26.8.</note> who hath promiſed to <hi>be in the middeſt of them that are gathered together in his Name.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 18.20.</note> Happy are we, if we be in the number of theſe few. If ſuch retchleſſe men were left to themſelves without any bridle of Law, or feare of Superiour and authority (of whom we ſpake before,) and ſuffered to doe what they pleaſed without any checke or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolment, we ſhould have our thinne Aſſemblies a great deale thinner, and our ſtreets, and fields, and houſes, and Ale-houſes, fuller-ſtuffed and thronged, then our Churches. And this may appeare hereby, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we have Lawes, and Magiſtrates, and Officers, and good examples of the chiefeſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall among us, yet they are few, a very few, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the reſt that are conſtant and conſcionable in their hearing, ſome, if their preſence and abſence were ballanced together, the waightier ſcole would be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their abſence, and would waigh downe their
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:21898:254"/>preſence, as being found too light. Others, albeit they dwell neere enough, are ſtarting away at every turne, and when they make ſhew of going to the Churche, turne aſide another way. Others are more carefull to fill the body, then to feed the ſoule, who take every, even the leaſt, occaſion to feaſt with their friends, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the feaſt that God hath prepared in his houſe, and not regarding it, though they even ſtarve their owne ſoules. Others are gadding, yea, madding in a manner after every vanity, and doe delight much more in the pleaſure of the body, then in the profit that commeth to the Spirit. Others are weary of the Word, as the <hi>Iſraelites that loathed Manna.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 11.6.</note> Others have <hi>hired</hi> ground, and they muſt needs goe ſee it: others have <hi>bought five yoke of Oxen,</hi>

                     <hi>I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that none of thoſe men, which were bidden, ſhall taſte of my Supper.</hi> Theſe are they that are araigned, as guilty of the neglect of heavenly things, who will ſometimes ſeeme to beare ſome affection to the houſe of God, but partly their profits, and partly their pleaſures car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them another way: of all which the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,

                     <hi>Curſed is he that doth the worke of the Lord</hi> negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently or <hi>deceitfully.</hi> All theſe ſtand under this heauy curſe of the Lord, and therefore I counſell them to looke to it betimes, to ſeeke the Lord while he may
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21898:255"/>be found, and to meet him by unfained repentance while he is here.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">Contempt of the Word, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the Kingdome.</note> touching the contempt of the Word, who ſeeth not how common it is, which notwithſtanding is the top of impiety, and that many have filled the meaſure of their ſinnes till it be full, that the cry of them is come up to heaven? If any aske the cauſe, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Our great negligence and generall coldneſſe have brought this evill upon us, and God doth hereby, in his deepe, and yet juſt Iudgement, revenge our careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his Service, by giving us over into all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe. The Word of the Lord, by which wee ſhall all be judged at the laſt Day, is ſo farre from hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men in awe, and from having their lives and hearts in ſubjection, that they reject it from them as a needleſſe thing, and regard it no longer. The Miniſter may teach what he will, and threaten as long as he liſt, but theſe Gallants, like <hi>Gallio</hi> in the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<note place="margin">Acts 18.17.</note> 
                     <hi>care for none of thoſe things.</hi> The time hath beene, when the Word hath beene reverenced, even by ſuch as were not converted by it, nor transformed into the obedience of it, yet it hath held them in ſome awe: but now in theſe our dayes, looſeneſſe, and licenciouſneſſe have generally prevailed in every place, and ſinne is growne to ſuch an head and height, as if the Word were but a Scare-crow, and all Religion but a fable. We are come to this paſſe, to mocke at zeale and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to contemne the Profeſſors of it. And who are they? Verily not onely ſuch as are wiſe in their owne eyes, but alſo ſuch as cannot themſelves give the meaning of one Precept of the Law, or of one Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Prayer, ſuch as cannot render any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their faith, neither an anſwer to any that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them a reaſon of the hope that is in them, through want and contempt of knowledge; yet have they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21898:255"/>knowledge enow to deride ſuch as labour earneſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge. Every baſe and deboſhed fellow, full of prophaneneſſe and impurity, hath learned to upbraid ſuch with purity, that any way love Religion: ſo that we may ſee with our eyes, and heare with our eares, ſuch as are truly religious, no leſſe ſcoffed and ſcorned, even at home among their owne brethren, neighbours, acquaintance, and friends, then if they lived among the very Savages. It is well knowne to thoſe that are but little converſant in Hiſtory, how the Chriſtians are taunted and reviled, that live among the Turkes and Sarazins, for the Chriſtian Religion, and what an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burden they beare. But is it much better thinke you, with many poore Chriſtian ſoules, though they live among their owne people? if they be any whit zealous in the Truth, and will not runne riot with the multitude, if they will not ſweare commonly, and be drunke for company, if they will once fall to reprove ſinne in others, what is this reckoned but flat or ranke Puritaniſme? and ſuch are no leſſe hated and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no leſſe taunted and traduced, then if they lived among the Infidels and Barbarians, the Paganes and open profeſſed enemies. Nay, I would this were all. For Religion it ſelfe, (to ſet aſide mens perſons) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth in very many places, a very by-word, and a matter of reproach. True it is, the Iewes ſinned with an high hand againſt God, they loved not the Oracles of God, neither walked they worthy of his calling and chuſing of them before other Nations; and therefore worthily deſerved to be forſaken of God, who had firſt forſaken him: howbeit they never proceeded to this top of ſinne, to make a mocke of their Religion it ſelfe, they never ſcorned the Word of the ever-living God. But we have learned to ſticke at nothing, wee are come thus farre, to treade under our feete, like
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21898:256"/>Dogs and Swine, the precious Iewell of the Goſpell, as if it were a curſe, rather then a bleſſing unto a Kingdom. O, how happy were it for theſe men, that God would give them eyes to ſee theſe their ſinnes, and hearts to bewaile them betimes, which now are hidden from them, before the time of Iudgement come, which doubtleſſe cannot bee farre off from every one of them!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> let us all account, that our happineſſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth above, not beneath: in heaven, not upon the earth: in being partakers of the Kingdome, and enjoying the bleſſed preſence of God, not in riches, or abundance, not in honour or worldly dignity. Such as will have true comfort in this life, muſt learne to looke beyond this life,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.27.</note> that he <hi>may ſee him that is inviſible,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaketh of <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11. For albeit a man flow in wealth ſo much as heart can wiſh, albeit he abound in honour, and glory, and eſtimation, that the world eſteeme him the onely happy man, yet ſhall he finde in the middeſt of all, ſundry diſcontentments, perplexities, croſſes, and vexations, and himſelfe far from true happineſſe: ſo that he muſt not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the things preſent and before his feete, but muſt looke further then this life. Hee that will not feare death <hi>the king of terrour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 18.14.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> calleth it, muſt looke beyond death, and ſee the Land of Canaan before he come into it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did from the mount. Death is dreadfull and fearefull to the fleſh, when we ſee no more in it, but the diſſolution of the ſoule and body; but if we have the eyes of faith to looke further, and conſider both from what evils it freeth us, and to what good it bringeth us, we have great comfort and conſolation in it, ſo that we may triumph over it. So he that will have true and ſound joy in this world, muſt looke beyond it, to the joyes of the World to come:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21898:256"/>He that would have comfort in trouble, muſt caſt his eyes beyond trouble, and looke up to <hi>this Kingdome,</hi> which Chriſt Ieſus promiſeth in this place, like the Mariner, who being toſſed in the Sea, comforteth himſelfe with the remembrance of the deſired Haven where he would be. Now this point, to wit, of eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our happineſſe to conſiſt in heaven, hath many particular branches. Firſt, we muſt long earneſtly for it. If the Saints account them bleſſed that dwell in the houſe of Prayer, and of his worſhip, how much more to dwell in the houſe of his glorious preſence? He that loveth the Kingdome of Heaven will long for it: he that loveth it not, longeth nor for it. The Crowne of righteouſneſſe is laid vp for ſuch <hi>as love the appearance of Chriſt.</hi> For whiles we are at <hi>home in the body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.8. 2 Cor. 5.2.</note> 
                     <hi>we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. He that is from home, longeth greatly to be at his houſe. This body is but a poore cottage, that muſt ſhortly be diſſolved and laid downe: our chiefe manſion and habitation is above in the heavens. Secondly, we muſt pray for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. It is the meaning in part of the ſecond Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdome come.</hi> For we pray therein not onely for the Kingdome of grace, but for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory alſo. This is the prayer and requeſt of all the Saints, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 22.20. 1 Cor. 15.25. Heb. 1.13. Acts 2.35.</note> The Kingdome is as yet come onely in part, we ſee not all things <hi>put under his feete:</hi> ſinne and Satan are not yet ſubdued, many oppoſitions are made againſt it; have we not juſt cauſe therefore, to crave both the enlarging of the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſtretching the Curtaines thereof, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the finiſhing of theſe dayes of ſinne? Thirdly, let us endure with joy all ſorts of afflictions, whereunto we are called, and which it ſhall pleaſe God to lay upon us, and to try us withall, conſidering that they are no way comparable to the glory that ſhall be revealed to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21898:257"/>the ſonnes of God. We are all, that will be the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt, forewarned of troubles and afflictions that abide us, and that we ſhall be hated for his Names ſake; howbeit, the next life will make amends for all, we ſhall have a ſuper-abundant recompence for all our ſufferings; <hi>It is our Fathers pleaſure to beſtow upon us the Kingdome.</hi> He that loſeth his life for his ſake, ſhall finde it. Fourthly, let us rejoyce and comfort our ſelves daily in the expectation of our full and finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and Redemption at the laſt day. Many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and many ſinnes doe yet hang about us, many wants and workes of darkneſſe compaſſe us on every ſide, all theſe together with the remnants of ſorrowes ſhall quickly be done away in the great Day of the Lord, when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of God:
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.11.</note> then indeed he ſhall be <hi>made marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in all them that beleeve.</hi> And as the ends of the world are come upon us, and the Day of our perfect reconciliation draweth neere, ſo ought we to rejoyce the more, and to lift up our heads the higher, that as we have ſaid in our trouble,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou haſt brought us into the duſt of death;</hi> ſo we may ſay againe, with joy of Spirit, <hi>Thou, Lord, haſt drawne us out of many waters, His right hand hath done great things for us, for which we reioyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it is our duty to walke worthy of ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to live godly in Chriſt Ieſus, that ſo wee may have comfort <hi>in that Day.</hi> Such as looke and hope hereafter to be made like unto Chriſt, muſt waſh their hands,
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.3.</note> and clenſe their hearts, and <hi>purifie themſelves even as he is pure.</hi> But it may be ſaid, Wee may repent at leiſure, and at the laſt Day, and that is farre off. Nay, the Scripture putteth ſuch fooliſh conceits from us, and telleth us that <hi>the Lord is at hand,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.7.</note> the comming of the Lord draweth neere. Beſides, then is not the time
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21898:257"/>of mercy, but of juſtice to the impenitent. For as death leaveth us, ſo ſhall the Iudgement Day finde us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5.
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Wee muſt all appeare before the Judgement Seat of Chriſt.</hi> But wherefore? to bring us to repentance? and to ſee whether we will turne from our ſinnes to him? No, that is not the end: but to receive the things which we have done in our body, whether good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. The old world no doubt, when they ſaw the raine that fell, were deſirous to enter into the Arke, but the flood was come, and it was too late.
<note place="margin">Exod. 14.23, 25.</note> The Egyptians purſuing Iſrael into the middeſt of the Sea, were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to turne backe, and to flye from the face of Iſrael, but the Lord tooke off their Chariot wheeles that they drave them heavily, and it was too late. The fooliſh Virgins cried, <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 25.11, 12.</note> but the doore was ſhut, and they received this uncomfortable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Verily, I ſay unto you, I know you not: which verifieth the ſaying of Chriſt elſewhere, <hi>Many,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 13.24.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſay unto you, will ſeeke to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> Such as can wiſh for Heaven, ſhould alſo ſtudy to learne the way to Heaven. It was the wiſh of <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſe prophet, though himſelfe were unrighteous, that hee might <hi>dye the death of the righteous.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 23, 10.</note> For albeit hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not to lead the life of the righteous, yet hee could be content to die their death: though he were at warre with God, yet he was deſirous to enter into their peace: and though he would not be like them in the beginning of his daies, yet he was willing his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end ſhould be like theirs. But as hee was ignorant of the way, ſo he was as careleſſe to enter into it. This putteth us in minde of ſundry meditations. Firſt, it is our duty to conſult with the Word, and to try all our actions by it, whether they pleaſe God, as the gold is tryed by the touch-ſtone, whether it bee currant or counterfeit, and as the worke is tried by the rule, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21898:258"/>it be right or crooked. Hence it is that Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.21.</note> 
                     <hi>He that doth truth, commeth to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God: but he that doth evill, hateth the light, neither commeth to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> For natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men love darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evill.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31.</note> Secondly, we ought to <hi>iudge our ſelves</hi> here, that ſo we may eſcape the Iudgement of God hereafter. If we will not judge our ſelves, we ſhall be condemned with the wicked world, for the Lord himſelfe will enter into Iudgement with us. We muſt to this purpoſe ſummon, accuſe, examine, convince, and condemne our ſelves, that he may acquit us, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge us, and abſolve us. Wee muſt try and examine our ſelves by the Touch-ſtone of the Law, and looke into it as upon a glaſſe, whereby wee may ſee the leaſt ſpot and wrinkle. Thirdly, we muſt watch and pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
<note place="margin">Luke 21.36.</note> that wee may bee <hi>found ſo doing, when the Lord commeth, Luke</hi> 11. and be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſſe, and that wee may ſtand before the Sonne of man. But if the evill ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſay in his heart, My maſter deferreth and delayeth his comming,
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.45, 46.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſhall begin to beate his fellow ſervants,</hi> and to eate and drinke, and to bee drunken: the Lord of that ſervant will come in a day when hee looketh not for him, and in an houre when hee is not ware, and wil cut him in ſunder, and will appoint him his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the unbeleevers. Fourthly, we muſt practiſe the workes of mercy toward the members of Chriſt, and bountifulneſſe to the godly in all their diſtreſſes. Happy will that Day be, and joyfull to them that have fed, and clothed, and viſited Chriſt in his members, that have come to ſuch as have beene ſicke and in priſon; which workes of mercy the Lord Ieſus will account, accept, and reward as done to himſelfe. But woe ſhall
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21898:258"/>it be to ſuch as ſhall have this charged upon them by Chriſt himſelfe the Iudge of quicke and dead,
